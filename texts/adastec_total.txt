How the Automated Bus Works: LiDARs, radars, cameras, and more This blog post explores ADASTEC's advanced automated driving software platform, highlighting its sensor fusion technology's role in transforming automated bus transportation.
October 3, 2023 ‍ The Key Technologies Behind ADASTEC SAE L4 Automated Bus The SAE Level-4 Automated Driving Software Platform offers significant advantages in public transport. Thanks to the high degree of automation, these buses can operate in specific geographical areas and under predetermined conditions without human intervention. This level of autonomy provides numerous benefits, including enhanced safety through advanced sensor systems and redundancy mechanisms. L4 Automated Buses can optimize traffic flow, reduce congestion, and increase efficiency. ADASTEC's automated bus also prioritizes accessibility and features to accommodate passengers with different needs.
Moreover, the Karsan e-Atak bus covers the arrangements made to enable disabled passengers to travel accessible and comfortably by overcoming physical barriers such as entering and exiting the bus, accessing the interior, and seating arrangements. For passengers and disabled passengers to have an accessible automated bus experience, ADASTEC's automated bus provides passengers with a unique experience with its kneeling feature in compliance with E.U. Regulations. In addition, L4 Automated Bus contributes to a sustainable and environmentally friendly transportation ecosystem through automated buses, electric vehicles, and hybrid vehicles. Integrating the SAE Level-4 Automated Driving Software Platform has enormous potential to revolutionize public transport and create a safer, more efficient, and inclusive mobility experience for passengers.
How do all the sensors work together?
The Autonomous Vehicle employs sensor fusion for detection while navigating city streets. "flowride.ai" uses multi-mode signals for RGB and thermal camera images, LiDAR points, Radar points, ultrasonic sensors, and H.D. map information. As a result, it detects all relevant traffic participants and objects accurately, robustly, and in real-time.
The sensor suite is designed as a multi-object that can be seen and detected by at least two sensor modalities. A fault-tolerant, redundant, and robust system can be established using five sensor sources.
The system can detect and classify objects around the vehicle in a 360-degree view. It determines the positions of objects and estimates their speed and direction. We ensure the output of multiple sensors (LiDAR, RGB Camera, and Thermal Cameras) for increased sensitivity in detecting objects and scene perception. In addition, the detection system can detect traffic lights and traffic signs. Thus, the vehicle can travel by following the rules in flowing traffic.
How do these systems function together?
Sensor fusion technology plays a crucial role in operating L4 automated buses, especially when integrating LiDAR (Light Detection and Range Shifting), RGB cameras, RADAR, and GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System).
By combining data from these sensors, automated buses can comprehensively and accurately understand their environment. LiDAR sensors detect obstacles, pedestrians, and other traffic participants in extraordinary detail by creating a precise 3D map of the environment.
Cameras provide visual information that enables the recognition of road signs, traffic lights, and visual cues. GNSS systems allow buses to navigate predefined routes, providing accurate positioning and localization data. Through sensor fusion techniques, the strengths of each sensor can be exploited, its limitations can be compensated, and a holistic perception of the environment can be achieved. This combination of LiDAR, camera, and GNSS data enables the L4 Automated Buses to make informed decisions in real-time, providing reliable and safe autonomous operation on the road.
A.V. processes sensor data, localization information, and map data for decision-making. A.V. uses sensor fusion to interpret data and predict the behavior of other road users and potential hazards.

Overcoming Deployment Hurdles: ADASTEC's Approach to Automated Bus Integration ADASTEC faces multiple challenges when deploying automated buses, including managing varying weather conditions, ensuring vehicle reliability over extended project durations, and addressing infrastructure communication needs.
October 8, 2023 There are always challenges with each deployment. From ADASTEC's experience, it is essential to recognize them, assess each individually, and devise a solution to mitigate or eliminate them.
‍ One of the main challenges of each deployment is the varying weather conditions. Depending on where an automated bus gets deployed, it is vital to assess the environment's climate, including extreme weather conditions such as heavy rain, snow, and fog. To mitigate this challenge, ADASTEC has undergone tremendous amounts of testing in various climates around the globe. Furthermore, for this deployment, ADASTEC has collected vast amounts of data to handle the climate and weather conditions in East Lansing, Michigan. The company is very familiar not only with the area and the area's climate but also with its road conditions during all four seasons.
‍ The second challenge ADASTEC faces with each deployment is related to the vehicle's mechanical and standard component's reliability, maintenance, and sustainability. Since the project lasts two to four years (which is longer than most other deployments), it is essential to maintain the vehicle's reliability, maintenance, and sustainability. Therefore, this project needs to work with a reliable bus OEM partner, such as Vicinity Motor Corporation, available for any vehicle maintenance issue throughout the deployment.
‍ Another challenge that must be considered is the need for more availability of infrastructure communication. When deploying an automated bus, risks may occur due to infrastructure availability, reliability, and accuracy problems, affecting rider comfort. For this project, ADASTEC can mitigate this risk due to their experience with V2X communication on East Lansing public roads and the various research projects around V2X that are being proposed in this application.
‍ Finally, like with all new technology, ADASTEC faces challenges with human response and awareness of automated public transportation buses. Although people may have some attention of existing autonomous vehicle operations (small vehicles/shuttles s at lower speeds), the need for more understanding of medium-sized and medium-speed autonomous buses may cause operational risks. To address this challenge, ADASTEC continues to organize awareness-raising activities in addition to project announcements, videos, demos, and informational and warning signs.

Karsan Atak Electric; What you need to know about the model that stands out with its driverless features Karsan Atak Electric, which came to the fore with overseas orders in the process, is breaking new ground with its 4th-level autonomous driving technology.
What you need to know about the model that stands out with its driverless features Full Story At: LOG Breaking new ground in its class with its autonomous driving dynamics, Karsan Atak Electric is one of the important names of its brand that has made its name known abroad. Karsan, which has been successful in catching current trends in recent years, uses Level-4 autonomous driving technology in the Atak Electric model within the scope of its cooperation with ADASTEC, another Turkish company. It is also possible to see the future of transportation in this scheme, which includes the most severe technology before the 5th level, which is an entirely driverless experience. Atak Electric had expanded its borders with its first international order as of May. BSCI, one of the leading technology companies in Romania, has ordered an Autonomous Atak Electric to be used in the Industrial Park in the city of Ploeşti in this process. Before the domestic automobile, the electric rise comes from the Karsan front.
Atak Electric, which has a design line, draws attention at first glance with its LED daytime running lights. The electric motor working in Atak Electric, which has 230 kWh engine power, produces 2,400 Nm of torque and promises its user a high-performance driving experience. With a total battery capacity of 220 kWh with five 44 kWh batteries developed by BMW, the 8 m class Atak Electric can be charged in 5 hours with alternating current charging units and in 3 hours with fast charging units while staying ahead of its competitors with its 300 km range. Moreover, thanks to the regenerative braking system that provides energy recovery, the batteries can charge themselves up to 25 percent. The model, which offers a passenger capacity of 52 people, has two different seat placement options, 18+4 and 21+4 folding. Introduced for the first time in September 2018, Atak Electric is being developed on BMW infrastructure, as in Jest Electric.

Does Autonomous Buses mean no more bus drivers? Absolutely NOT!
Autonomous buses are not designed to replace bus drivers, but rather to enhance their roles and work environment.
October 4, 2023 Next stop, more bus drivers, please! We all have already heard that there is a global labor shortage for bus drivers. One of the solutions that has come up in recent years is launching automated/autonomous transit buses. Unfortunately, when transit workers hear the word “autonomous bus” or “automated bus,” they often think of a robot or machine taking over their job – But that’s not how we – ADASTEC Corp.- see it. In fact, we believe in the opposite - we need bus drivers and will continue to need them in the future!
First and foremost, it is essential to note that from a legislative standpoint, ALL autonomous/automated vehicles (including buses) still require a safety driver. According to NHTSA, “Every vehicle currently for sale in the United States requires the full attention of the driver at all times for safe operation (NHTSA.gov).” Of course, everyone asks, “When will they start allowing it?” And the answer is, “We don’t know.” From ADASTEC’s viewpoint, it will still take several years to pass such legislation. That is a good thing for two significant reasons:  one, to give the public time to adjust and trust in automated vehicles, and two, to develop and convert the workforce. Let us explain.
Everyone understands the first point of the public not being ready to trust a bus that drives without a bus driver. Waiting for the legislature to pass allows companies like ours to do many activities to educate the public and bring awareness to the new technology. By doing so, we can earn their trust and eventually carry them as our passengers in the future.
Regarding the second point of converting the workforce, we know we have some more explaining to do. Hear us out! Many of the municipalities ADASTEC is working with want to deploy automated buses NOT because of the labor shortage but because they see it as a workforce retention tool that can enhance the work environment for bus drivers. Yes, you read that correctly.
Currently, many, if not most, transit authorities and bus operators require their bus drivers to work split shifts since driving a public transit bus can be very tasking. However, split shift schedules make it very difficult for some bus drivers, especially those with a family or who wish to have a set working schedule. By deploying an automated bus, bus drivers can be promoted to Safety Bus Drivers . Not only can bus drivers expect higher pay, but they can also work an entire shift without having to take a break (since the vehicle drives itself – duh!). The only time a bus driver may have to interfere is when there is an obstacle on the road or in case of an emergency inside or outside the vehicle. As a result, it would allow bus drivers to earn higher salaries and work better hours to enhance their work-life balance.
What happens when legislature passes and bus drivers are removed from the wheel? Exactly – the bus driver gets promoted again and becomes a Bus Operator (Didn’t see that coming, huh?). This means that bus drivers will now sit in an operation room to monitor five, ten, or maybe an entire fleet of buses. From the operation room, they can communicate with the passengers of each bus (in cases of emergency, for example) and even remote-control drive buses around obstacles on the road. The bus driver can expect an increase in salary in addition to a set working schedule. Also, have we mentioned the safety aspects of working as a bus driver yet? MTA data recently found that 73% of attacks against transit workers are harassment of bus workers, including threats and spitting, among other offenses (Duggan, 2022). Guess what? That will no longer be the case with any bus driver that becomes a Bus Operator .
So, while deploying autonomous/automated buses may sound threatening at first, we at ADASTEC want to spread the word that we DO NOT wish any transit authority or operator to fire any of their bus drivers because we desperately need them. However, we are saying that you won’t have to look for or hire additional bus drivers if you start deploying autonomous buses. We also love the idea of transit agencies and bus operators creating a career path for bus drivers to not only give them opportunities to move up in their careers, but also to offer them better work times and, most importantly, a safer work environment.

ADASTEC selects Teledyne FLIR ADASTEC selects Teledyne FLIR thermal sensors for flowride.ai Level-4 autonomous bus platform.
Mass Transit Article: ADASTEC selects Teledyne FLIR ‍ Full Story at : MASS TRANSIT Recently, ADASTEC unveiled its level-four, full-size, full-speed autonomous bus platform, flowride.ai .
The Teledyne FLIR thermal cameras are necessary because the flowride.ai automation platform is built to run continuously throughout the year, including through ever-changing weather conditions. Thermal cameras work in conjunction with a variety of other sensor modalities to provide a secure autonomous driving system for situations when other cars, cyclists, and pedestrians all use the same route.
With a primary focus on enhancing the detection and safety of all vulnerable road users on or near the road and at bus stops, ADASTEC integrated thermal cameras. In order to more easily identify and categorize individuals who are partially hidden by surrounding vehicles and other typical roadside and urban objects, thermal cameras are a significant sensor technology.
The use of flowride.ai's thermal integration Two Teledyne FLIR thermal cameras are installed on the flowride.ai automation platform: one is located on the front of the bus to scan forward, and the other is mounted on the right side of the bus to scan side to side. In particular, humans standing close to local bus stops and crosswalks are detected by these locations, as are bicycles and animals that move into the route of the bus.
In order to provide redundancy and the flexibility to interpret the environment in a wide range of conditions and to make the most suitable decisions and take the necessary actions safely, the data from the thermal sensor is fused with data from RGB (visible light) cameras, LIDAR, ultrasonic sensors, and radars.

The Four Main Reasons You Should Consider a Factory-Fitted Automated Bus Over a Retrofit ADASTEC Corp., a pioneer in introducing factory-fitted solutions in the U.S. and Europe, emphasizes these advantages while ensuring transit agencies receive best-in-class, durable products tailored to their needs.
October 6, 2023 When deploying automated transit buses, one may consider the difference between working with a provider of a factory-fitted versus a retrofitted vehicle. Here are four reasons why a factory-fitted solution may be your best path forward for innovative, scalable, and efficient public transit solutions.
Scalability.
When deploying new buses, most transit agencies and operators are looking to replace five, ten, and sometimes an entire fleet of buses over several years. With a factory-fitted automated transit bus, transit agencies and operators order buses and work with the OEM on delivery date. In comparison, retrofitted vehicle providers may need help finding enough used/base vehicles to be transformed into automated transit buses, leading to long delays and ambiguous timeframes for when the vehicles will be delivered. It is also important to note that there is no specific agreement with the base vehicle producer, which means that the OEM can change the base vehicle model without prior permission. This may result in changes in the design and delivery times.
Warranty . The OEM warranty is one of the most important benefits of working with a vehicle provider that offers a factory-fitted solution. If anything is wrong with the bus, transit agencies and operators can contact the OEM and ask them for their support regarding maintenance and operations. The difficulty with retrofitted vehicles is that as soon as holes are drilled into a chassis,  the warranty from the OEM vanishes. This could result in significant costs if something needs to be fixed with the vehicle or the software and take the car out of operation.
Design.
When deploying automated transit buses, raising awareness and educating the public on the new technology is most important. Part of this process is ensuring that the bus looks like a regular public transit bus because– who would step foot into something that looks like a science project? By going the factory-fitted route, transit agencies, and operators can be sure that the automated bus looks like a regular transit bus with an innovative new design that merges the original “bus look” together with high-tech sensor technology. In addition, interior configurations, such as the number of wheelchair spaces and passenger seats, etc., can be defined by the customer depending on their needs. This is of the utmost importance since low floors, high ceilings, and kneeling functions contribute to much better accessibility and travel comfort.
Capacity, Range, and Durability.
It shouldn’t come as a surprise that new electric transit buses come with better and improved technology to maximize the power and range of the vehicle. Because of new innovative designs, new transit buses outshine retrofitted cars in that regard. In addition, most transit buses have an average useful life of about 10-12 years (dot.gov); depending on how old the retrofitted vehicle is, the cost of retrofitting the car may not justify the overall investment in the project due to the remaining short life span of the vehicle.
Naturally, there are drawbacks to opting for a factory-installed solution, such as a longer time to market. Design modifications may take longer since they must be integrated into the production line. In addition, whenever there is a change, the new vehicle must go through all the necessary tests and comply with the requirements of the OEM. However, by using the factory-fitted solution, transit agencies and operators are guaranteed a best-in-class product that will last its entire lifetime and won’t encounter any service interruptions. The vehicle will also fit their needs and the needs of their customers and can be scaled to any number desired in their fleet. Is there something wrong with the vehicle? Then, pick up the phone and talk to the OEM or our team so we can immediately assist you with your needs.
ADASTEC Corp.
offers a factory-fitted automated transit bus solution designed to fit the needs of each customer. ADASTEC is the first company to introduce factory-fitted automated transit bus solutions in the U.S. and Europe.

June 8, 2021 ADASTEC and Karsan Sign Agreement with Istanbul Technical University ITU, Karsan, and ADASTEC Partner to Develop Autonomous Atak Electric Bus At the signing ceremony; ITU Rector Prof.  Dr. İsmail Koyuncu said, “One of the most important pillars of digitalization today is the artificial intelligence technology, which is gaining importance day by day and is integrated with many industries. It is now possible to use it extensively in autonomous vehicle applications and tominimize the problems caused by human error. At ITU, we had been already working on this technology. But now, thanks to the R&D project we start with the vehicle manufacturer Karsan and its autonomous technology business partner ADASTEC, we will both be able to implement a completely domestic and national technology and have the chance to provide information and experience to other sectors with the new experiences we will gain. I hope that this project will be enhanced with the pioneering engineering perspective of Istanbul Technical University and turn into a success story.” Autonomous Atak Electric to be Utilized in ITU's R&D Project Dr.  Ali Ufuk Peker, CEO of ADASTEC, emphasized the added value of the work in his statement and said: “From production to sales, and service based business models, the automotive industry is one of the largest industrial and service sectors in every country in the world. Thanks to the R&D studies, academic publications, product and workforce demands from industry autonomous vehicles will be able to use more sophisticated and value-added information. We are very proud and pleased to undertake such a project under the leadership of ITU.” Okan Baş, CEO of Karsan, said: “With its pioneering role, Karsan started working to manufacture the public transportation vehicles of the future. Accordingly, at the beginning of the year, we introduced Autonomous Atak Electric, the first serial-manufacturedLevel-4 automated bus in Europe and America. After receiving our first order from Romania, we are now happy to respond to the request of ITU, one of the most respected educational institutions in Turkey. As part of this, we aim to deliver Autonomous Atak Electric for the 2021-2022 academic year. It is an honor for us and our country that our driverless 8-meter bus will be utilized and developed within the scope of R&D activities of ITU.” ADASTEC's flowride.ai Software Enables Level-4 Autonomous Driving Autonomous Atak Electric Bus, developed by the joint work of Karsan's R&D team and ADASTEC using the flowride.ai software on Atak Electric, Karsan's 100% electric model in the 8-meter class, will be used in project development studies within the scope of R&D activities of the university. This will pave the way for industrial and technology companies and the academia to develop technological products and services with high scientific depth and commercial potential.
‍ With ADASTEC’s flowride.ai software, Autonomous Atak Electric can navigate through streets without a human driver, is equipped with LiDAR sensors all around. Autonomous bus comes with innovative technologies such as an advanced RADAR in the front, high-resolution image processing with RGB cameras and extra driving safety thanks to thermal imaging cameras. Offering a Level-4autonomous driving experience in combination with these technologies,Autonomous Atak Electric can drive itself on a pre-arranged route. Capable of reaching speed of up to 50 kilometers per hour in all road conditions night and day when in self-driving mode, the bus can autonomously perform tasks previously done by a human driver such as pulling into bus stops on the route, managing the passengers getting on/off, navigating through roundabout, thorough fares or traffic lights etc.
