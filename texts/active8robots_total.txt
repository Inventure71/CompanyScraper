21 December 2018 By Antony Lovedale Time flies when you’re trying to keep up with the robotics and automation industry. As 2018 is coming to an end Active8 Robots is preparing for another big year in 2019.
Robotics is now affecting multiple industries and is no longer limited to automation. It is becoming part of our daily lives and that was reflected when the UR10 rang the bell for the New York Stock Exchange and Pepper taking the stand in Parliament in the UK.
The Rise of Cobots Cobots are on the up, and they are here to stay. Universal Robots continue to dominate the industry, as they seem to have mastered the art of collaborative robotic arms. They don’t try and venture out into grippers or sensors, but instead do what they do well and allow their partners to concentrate on the other aspects of robotics. This became even more true when they were acquired by Teradyne, who also own Mobile industrial Robots (MiR). These partnerships mean universal are now part of a strong robotics ecosystem. There are however, people doing other things within the cobot world, such as Franka Emika who have created the Panda Robot which has 7 axes. On top of this there are an increasing amount of industrial robot manufacturers who are venturing out into, or expanding on their section within, the collaborative robot market, such as ABB and FANUC.
Cobot Safety As for the safety of cobots, new sensors are making cobots and industrial robots safer. Features of cobots are now filtering out to larger industrial automation world, making industrial robots safer, but still by no means safe. This is a message that has been repeated over and over in 2018, but should be reiterated further in 2019; just because cobots are safer than industrial robots, they can still be dangerous depending on the application.
The fall of Rethink Sawyer and Baxter were popular, ground-breaking, revolutionary cobots. On top of this, they were a big part of Active8 Robots’ history. The fall of Rethink Robotics proves just how high consumer expectations are within the robotics industry, but Active8 Robots was pleased to hear that the brand will live on through Hahn Group.
Self Driving Cars Although some huge developments have been made in the automotive industry this year, there have also been some huge red flags. Sadly there was the first fatality from Uber, as well as some accidents from Tesla, however it is thought that most of these were cause by human error. Some places in the US already have automated cars, however these still have drivers.
Mobile Robots Mobile robots have become even more prominent in warehouses such as Ocado and Amazon. With the labour shortage, more prominent than ever with Brexit looming closer, companies have found it more and more difficult to retain staff in repetitive and straining jobs. The robots aren’t just filling labour shortages either, but are improving efficiency too, as they can complete the tasks at a faster rate.
2019 As for next year, robot and cobot development shows no sign of slowing down. In 2019, the focus for manufacturers will shift towards accelerated creation and deployment of more capable robots with advanced features and functions. Cobotswill also become increasingly popular in manufacturing operations. For example, it’s common in car plants today for humans to remain separate from robots on the plant floor. Machines moving parts of the car frame will automatically stop if human workers cross a barrier separating the two. However, in the not-too-distant future, given advances in technologies like machine vision and machine learning, cobots will be able to move in the same space as human workers.
Cobots are becoming a viable option for manufacturing operations largely because of their low-end price points, flexibility, and constantly evolving capabilities. Because of this, it’s going to be crucial that robots and cobots meet safety requirements, especially given they will be inter-operating with humans. Cobots are tailored to ISO standards with regards to safety, yet because of their functionality, industry must develop further safety standards. For example, cobots have defined speeds of motion. If you surpass designated speeds, then cobots can’t inter-operate with humans because they can create and cause damage.
If manufacturers start making more capable cobots and have them handling bigger task loads, they become stronger and more capable of damage. That’s why the safety element becomes important. Manufacturers want cobots to be able to move within the same space as humans, but they certainly don’t want them banging into or hurting them in any way. Safety concerns surrounding big robots can be addressed by exclusion. For cobots, you must be much more careful.

27 September 2018 By Antony Lovedale We are beginning our final day at the PPMA show! Not only have we already met so many of you who are interested in our products, it has also been exciting to be able to walk around and speak to other exhibitors who we could work with in the future, as well as seeing all of the brand-new technology that is becoming available.
It’s been incredibly exciting to hear all the potential projects that could be just around the corner for Active8 Robots, some with big companies and others with small and medium sized enterprises. On top of this, it’s been brilliant to bump into some familiar faces; companies we have worked with in the past, and some we are currently working with.
Our mini-factory cell, which removes and replaces the lid on a card-board box, has been a real success. It has perfectly demonstrated to any visitors exactly how we can integrate multiple brands of robot into one solution in order to create your bespoke solution. On top of this it shows how our end of arm tooling can work in a delicate manner, repeatedly moving the cardboard lid without damaging it.
We can’t wait for our final day at PPMA today, just make sure you don’t cut any corners as you might end up missing our stand! If you want to chat about how we could help you, then any of the staff on our stand would be more than happy to take the time to talk with you, or if you’re just browsing for the future then make use of our interactive iPads and don’t forget to take a brochure.

”, it has been revealed that NASA plan to end their active efforts to restore contact with Opportunity.
After having been silent for more than four months, following a major dust storm, efforts to contact the Opportunity Mars rover are expected to end soon. NASA will however, continue to listen for signals from the spacecraft for months to come.
The rover has been on Mars since January 2004, and last contacted Earth this year on June 10. A strong dust storm blocked the sun and meant that the rover’s solar panel was block, putting it into low-power mode. Since then NASA’s controllers have been implementing an effort known as “active listening” where they transmitted commands to the rover in the event it was unable to revive itself and listened for any transmissions by the rover in response.
After more than a month, the rover has missed every opportunity to respond to the commands from NASA and so soon the active listening effort will end. Lori Glaze, acting director of NASA’s planetary science division, said “we intend to keep pinging Opportunity on a daily basis for at least another week or two”.  Glaze said that a factor in ending the active listening campaign is to prepare for the landing of the InSight Spacecraft on Mars Nov. 26 th . Doing this will ensure that all orbital assets are focused on a successful landing of insight.
Some former rover controllers have been critical about this plan, arguing that there hasn’t been enough time to see if Opportunity could be revived. NASA countered that once the active listening effort ends, it will still listen for any transmissions from the robot but will not transmit any commands to it.
For now, the active listening effort continues, with rover controllers playing a “wakeup song” each day. But when this active listening ends, it will be a case of waiting to see if Opportunity knocks.

As a multi-platform integrator, Active8 Robots is skilled at benchmarking, helping you choose the best robots for your application.
What is benchmarking?
Most technical fields use benchmarking in one way or another. It is used both directly, to test our solutions against those of others, and indirectly, when deciding which new technology to buy.
Benchmarks give us a clear indication of whether a technology or solution is suitable for your needs. Unfortunately, there has been a lack of benchmarks in robotics for a while now. Task based benchmarks are even more uncommon.
Task-based benchmarking So why is Task-Based Benchmarking so uncommon in robotics? In part it’s because of the lack of a benchmarking culture within the robotics industry, but it’s also due to the fact that robotic tasks are so complex.
There are a few ways to measure the performance of a robot. Different areas of robotics will have different benchmarking needs; there is a great difference between industrial and collaborative robots.
Task based bench marking can be thought of as a sort of “benchmark for the real world”. They give a better understanding of how a robot performs. Performance metrics are both helpful and necessary, however they wouldn’t be able to answer the question “will this robot be able to assemble my product?” and that’s exactly the question we are looking to answer throughout our automation consultations. Luckily, as we are not biased towards any one solution, we can ask this question in relation to all the robots available to us and see which can complete your task in the most efficient way.
Collaborative robots bring with them even more challenges for task-based benchmarking. Not only do the benchmarks for these robots need to test performance, they should also test its safety features and abilities to collaborate. Although the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) are currently developing a set of benchmarking protocols for collaborative robots that is due to be completed this year, until then, it is down to us to benchmark our own robots.

Due to the mass and high speeds of industrial robots, it is always unsafe for a human to remain in the work area of the robot during automatic operation. Safety for industrial robots is mainly about isolating personnel from the robots work envelope and ensuring the movement can be easily stopped in an emergency.
Today’s industrial robots range from lightweight benchtop units to large machines powerful enough to manipulate objects weighing 1000kg. Clearly, the risk depends very much on the particular robot and its application, so the starting point for safeguarding a robot cell will always be a risk assessment. With this in mind, safety should always be considered during the early planning of a robotic application.
Physical perimeter guards are the standard for ensuring robot safety, though light guards, laser area scanners and pressure-sensitive mats can be appropriate for use. Other types of guarding that are occasionally adopted include a camera-based system and roller shutter doors.
Collaborative Robot Safety The advantage of using a collaborative robot is that these robots need minimal or no external safety devices to be sure that the application is safe for the workers. In other words, the robot and all its tools can be fully safe for the workers and the need for traditional guarding is not required.
Collaborative robots, or cobots, are designed to work alongside humans to perform tasks simultaneously; this is a new era for robotics. Collaborative robots are power and force limited robots meaning that they are equipped with force sensing. This means that in any situation they can feel an abnormal force and stop their motion immediately. Although these robots can still not avoid a crash, they can reduce its impact and avoid certain types of incidents, like crushing accidents.
However, it is still important to carry out certain assessments to ensure the entire robotic cell is safe, for example, if the robot has a sharp object as part of its end-of-arm-tooling it can still be considered dangerous for close proximity users.

The network, comprises integrators across Silver, Gold and Platinum accreditation, ranging from small, niche operators to large enterprises, operating in markets as diverse as entertainment and film, food and drink and the aerospace supply chain.
Bath based Active8 Robots joined the System Partner Program in 2017. The industrial and collaborative robot integrator provides automation solutions across all sectors of the manufacturing industry, from conceptualisation through to delivery.
Now into their fourth year as official KUKA system partners, Active8 have witnessed an increase in endorsements of robot automation across a number of sectors, as businesses focus upon operational resilience in light of the recent pandemic, and other influencing factors such as Brexit and the skills gap. This increase in activity and Active8 Robots’ continued commitment to the KUKA brand sees them achieve Gold system partner status within the partner program.
“It is a tiered structure,” says Bernard Bagley, Head of Robot Sales, General Indus­try, KUKA UK. “We encourage and support our system partners right up to Platinum level, based upon the number of robots they sell. Active8’s sales of KUKA industrial robots has increased in recent months, earning them their well-deserved promotion”.
Of the accreditation, Michael Payne, Food & Beverage Sector Manager, KUKA UK said “Their (Active8 Robots) level of technical capability and attention to detail make for some truly impressive systems. Active8 Robots is well positioned in the market as one of the UK’s leading automation suppliers, particularly within the field of robotics for food and beverage automation”.
“80 per cent of our robot sales are through system partners,” says Bernard. “What they bring to the table is specialist skills and knowledge in their sector, for customers that need equipment integration and programming. For some, we are the first point of contact for businesses who wish to start their automation journey. Having had no exposure to robot automation before it can be daunting to understand exactly what they wish to achieve. This is where our system partners support this process”.
KUKA believes the food and beverage sector will be the biggest growth market for robots in 2021. The future of manufacturing is about being flexible and agile. Those companies with robots are able to react better and faster to challenges, such as the recent crisis by being able to scale production up or down as a reaction to market demands.
Michael Codd, Business Development Lead at Active8 Robots says: “Although the lockdowns affected the supply chain in terms of product and labour, the demand for food and beverage products soared. As a consequence of this, we experienced an increased demand for robotics and automation technologies. We are seeing some food and drinks manufacturers / processors struggling to fulfil orders whilst trying to stay relevant in a dynamic market environment and on the other hand, we are seeing their competitors investing in smart automation, not only to scale production and streamline operations, but to be able respond quickly to the increasingly variable and volatile demands of their customers. For example, upgrading one of our processing and packaging customers’ automation levels allowed them to introduce new products on the same lines that could be switched over swiftly and produce shorter runs”.
Every industry and every company have its own unique requirements and regardless of what they might be, we have seen those who have adopted the use of robots improve their competitive edge, leaps and bounds. This has been complemented by other factors such as less waste, greater energy efficiency, greater throughput and of course greater profitability.
We are confident that the government’s Super Deduction Scheme will make robots more accessible to more British companies in all sectors and encourage them to bring their automation investments forward so that they too can reap the benefits.” Having recently moved into new premises and with an expansion of their head count, Michael is anticipating big things for Active8 Robots and their immediate future. “It was an absolute pleasure to present Active8 Robots with their well-deserved promotion to Gold partner status. I thoroughly enjoy working with the whole team. It’s great to see such a friendly and engaging bunch succeed, and I expect this success to continue as demand for robot automation within the food & beverage sector continues to rise”.
“KUKA’s technical expertise and passion for innovation combined with outstanding support for its system partners greatly enhances our capabilities. This helps us deliver a seamless integration service to our customers, which in turn helps them transform, perform and thrive better and faster. As our business grows, our relationship will grow. Not only that, it’s always a pleasure working with such a great team!” Bernard concludes “The partner program encourages constructive engagement between KUKA and our integrators. As time goes on, our relationships become closer: an open and sym­biotic partnership. It’s win-win-win, for us, our system partners and the customers”.

11 September 2018 By Antony Lovedale With all the incoming help from robots, automation and Artificial Intelligence a four-day working week could be on the horizon. It’s previously been established that a job expands to fit the time you have to do it in, so perhaps a four-day working week could be just as, or more, time efficient than five.
Unions are calling to switch to a four-day working system, although disappointingly not until “some time later this century” when robots and algorithms can better do the boring things we’re all stuck doing now. Some are concerned that bosses and shareholders will be the main people to benefit from this new tech, and so it must be ensured that the perks are shared with the people out there getting it done on the floor.
Frances O’Grady, general secretary of the union congress, called for a shorter working week, so workers could share the wealth generated by technological advances in AI, automation and robotics. The TUC said new science such as these should pave the way for improved working conditions – including better pay and reduced workloads – instead of fuelling a fear of job cuts. They went on to state that employers and the Government need to work together to make the growth in AI a positive move for workers. Following this, the TUC’s report found 74% of staff would welcome scientific help to give them more control over their working lives with eight in 10 saying they want to reduce their hours.
John Tamny, author of “The End of Work: Why Your Passion Can Become Your Job has said in May that the robot will be “the greatest friend to the worker… we’ve ever seen”. He states that with robots increasing our productivity humans only need to put in a four-day work week and will have more opportunity to pursue what they love. You can hear more of his opinion in this episode of The Blaze.
On a final note, the Netherlands, a country widely-known for its high-class education system, economy prosperity and good healthcare, has a four-day working week. On average they work 29 hours a week – and they are one of the happiest counties of all.

This cobot can be used for machine tending, circuit board testing and other precise tasks; with its actuators, the cobot can feel its way into fixtures. Sawyer is perfect for tasks that other industrial robots are not capable of completing due to their large footprints and lack of mobility.
Sawyer is completely unique in the cobot world. Across its arm Sawyers has 7 degrees of freedom (mimicking the human arm), it is fully compliant and CE certified, and it has and embedded vision system with head and wrist cameras. Sawyer also boasts force feedback, adding to its safe use around humans, and is so easy to use that no programming knowledge is required due to the Intera software that it uses.
Sawyer is faster, lighter, stronger and more precise than its older sister, Baxter. Sawyer has been specifically designed to be able to operate and reach in smaller areas and can work side-by side with humans in these spaces. This 1260mm reach means Sawyer can be used for a whole variety of new applications and the 7 degrees of freedom in the arm mean that it can even reach into the tightest of spaces. Unlike its sibling, Sawyer has a smaller footprint of just 2 by 2 by 5 feet, only one arm, weighs 42lb, and has a heavier payload of 8.8lb.
Sawyer’s new embedded vision system includes a head camera for wide view applications. The Cognex camera in its wrist allows it to support many complicated vision tasks. These two cameras combined means that rapid re-deployment and dynamic re-orientation takes even less time, and with many more features constantly being added, Sawyer will only keep on improving.
Sawyer is incredibly adaptable-  watch it work on different applications in different factories around the world.
Rethink Robtics’ Jim Lawton says the following characters make Sawyer stand out: It’s good at environments that change. “The robot positioning system coordinates frames, making it good at varied, unstructured environments,” said Lawton.
It’s good at shifting from task to task. “You could have it do one thing one day, and then show it how to do something else the next day,” he says.
Motion control, involving mechanical compliance and impedance controls, make it behave more like a human. “You don’t need to shift everything in the environment for the robot,” said Lawton.

Human/ robot collaboration (HRC) is becoming more and more common, as agile and lightweight robots that can move payloads of up to 35kg are already available and on the market. These robots aren’t as “dangerous” as industrial robots due to their slower motion sequences and lower net weights. This means they can be more easily integrated onto the factory floor without taking up a large footprint, as there is no need for the caging that comes with industrial robots.
Implementing cobots within the food industry obviously comes with extra hygiene and care requirements. In the food industry, the quality of the products and their faultless further processing and handling is especially important.
When gripping already packaged food in preparation for transport there is the added need for delicacy which can easily be fulfilled by lightweight cobots. A perfect example of this is the Italian Cascina Italia company where over 2.5 million eggs must be packed every day by a UR5 robot with pneumatically controlled grippers. The robot packs around 15,000 eggs every hour.
Further to this cobots have proven to be useful in environments with special climatic or hygienic conditions as most can work in environmental temperatures between 0 and 50 degrees Celsius. They can also function in low-oxygen environments which would require complex equipment for any human staff. These high-care machines are sealed airtight with a smooth outer housing to ensure that there are almost no dust or deposits.
Other cobots such as the KR Agilus Hygienic Machine (HM) are designed to be used in applications involving direct contact with food stuffs and pharmaceutical substances. The combination of corrosion-resistant surfaces, food-compatible lubricants and stainless-steel parts ensure the highest level of hygiene.
Automation with cobots is an innovation which especially benefits small and medium-sized companies (SMEs). The use of robot arms can be implemented economically, and the small size of the robots and their simple programming allows them to be used for the most varied applications in the SME sector.

Gender diversity is important in any industry, but especially in STEM. It is essential that the women of the future have role models to aspire to and be inspired by. For many young girls there is a real absence of female role models in STEM. This doesn’t just cause a lack of role models for girls but leaves a hole in the development of the industry, as the more diverse a team is the more creativity and innovation there can be. This therefor works to benefit the whole industry.
On top of these reasons, if a business really wants to understand its marketplace, and deliver products, solutions and services to the broader population, it needs to be representative of that population. Despite this though, women are still disproportionately under-represented in STEM occupations.
There is a clear need to address the gender balance within STEM occupation. Women currently make up just 24% of all people employed in STEM industries. A key area for concern is the huge drop-off in the number of girls studying core STEM subjects at the age of 16.
“In 2017, just 35% of girls chose maths, physics, computing or a technical vocational qualification, compared to 94% of boys.”* Dr Roz Bekker from Johnson and Johnson says that “We recognise that, in order to get a better gender balance in an area, you need to inspire children from a very young age. You need to profile role models so children – or young women – who are thinking about a career in STEM, will think, ‘Look at what these women have done… I can do this, too”.
Maintaining gender balance throughout talent pipelines, at all levels, is another key concern. Some have suggested that diversifying the range of routes into organisations is crucial for creating a diverse workforce. By creating routes from university degrees to apprenticeship schemes, work placements, and scholarship programmes, more of the talent pool will be exposed to these organisations and the opportunity to drive gender balance in the recruitment process can be increased.
Addressing the gender balance in recruitment opens the door for a wider system and culture of inclusivity and support. “We set up networking events to give the opportunity for women to improve self-confidence in business and networking skills alongside unconscious bias training,” says Dr Bekker.
Aspiring to and maintaining a diverse workforce should be a simple business decision and one that all businesses should employ. “We are very focused on achieving that 50:50 equilibrium,” says Dr Barker. “We are all about innovation that meets the unmet needs of patients, and research shows that diversity can further foster that.” We have some pretty impressive women working at Active8 Robots, including Chrissa Hopper, our Process Engineer.

This new series is intended to enable faster development for a wider variety of applications than the standard line. A UR spokesperson has said the new e-Series is the equivalent of “upgrading from the old iPhone to the New iPhone”. Universal Robots excels at designing automated solutions that bring maximum safety, ROI, and potential to businesses of all shapes and sizes.
The UR e-Series was released this summer and began shipping to customers from August, yet the older cobot arms are still being sold alongside them, as each has different sets of benefits. With a similar look on the outside to the older models, you’d be forgiven for thinking it was the same series of robots, but its what’s inside the new UR e-Series that counts.
The e-Series has greater precision and sensitivity provided by a built-in tool-centric force/torque sensor. It also has better pose repeatability and significantly quieter operation. Another goal of this series is to provide an improved user experience, with a redesigned control panel and new programming and software to make deployment and programming easier, regardless of application.
In the UR3 alone the repeatability has improved from +/-0.1 to +/-0.03, which is a huge improvement and is now even more suitable for precise finishing, assembly, and electronic tasks, which is exactly what a robot of this size should be doing. On top of this, the engineers putting the UR3es to work will be happy, as the noise level of the cobot has been reduced from 70dB to 60dB.
Active8 Robots has the capabilities to integrate the UR e-series into your factory.
New features- Pendant ; The new Universal Robot Pendant has streamlined the user interface layout so there are less clicks to reach common commands. This provides simpler programming, easier navigation, and higher resolution HMI with Capacitive touchscreen. There are also new languages available and all software has been updated on common .urp method.
Axis 6 ; There are new serial comms available for the user to Axis 6 (no cable for RS-485 type grippers). The E-series also offers faster polling rates on joints and overall better control sue to the 500Hz system bus up the arm- up from 125Hz on CB3 controller. Also, 2Amps of peak current on User digital outputs.
This Axis also includes a Force Torque sensor that provides the ability for out of the box sanding / polishing / assembly type force feedback controls. Additionally, the software wizard on-board robot provides automatic payload estimation.
Main Control board; The new main control board provides 20 digital in and 16 digital out.
Two new Programmable Safety functions; To provide an even safer experience there are new programmable safety functions that help provide better Stopping time and distance. Furthermore, the safety rated elbow monitoring provides force and angle.

06 September 2018 By Antony Lovedale Opportunity Rover is Nasa’s longest-lived robot on Mars, but there are worries that it may not survive much longer. The golf-cart-size robot landed on Mars in January 2004, followed three weeks later by Spirit, its twin, which landed on a different part of the Red Planet.
Both robots were initially on a three- month mission to hunt for signs of water activity. Both successfully found such evidence, and then continued to explore the planet for months after their three-month anticipated life-span.
Spirit finally stopped being active after getting stuck in a sand tap in 2010, but Opportunity remained resilient. Opportunity has gone on to travel farther on the surface of any other world than any other vehicle, robotic or crewed.
Due to dust storms on Mars in June, Opportunity entered hibernation mode until the atmosphere clears again. This was due to the fact that Opportunity is powered by solar panels, meaning that Opportunity couldn’t reach enough sunlight to recharge its batteries. The rover has been silent since June 10 and has been in hibernation mode ever since.
The threat Opportunity is under is very real. As the rover is unable to operate its onboard heaters in its current state there is a chance that Opportunity could freeze to death if the temperature drops low enough. The cold temperatures can snap electronic circuits inside the Rover if they aren’t warmed.
The storm did appear to be passing last month, and the skies are beginning to clear. However, it is thought that it will take an extended period of sunny weather to wake up Opportunity, if the rover is still alive. There is also the chance that dust may have settled on the solar panels of Opportunity, meaning it won’t be able to recharge at all.
NASA officials have said that mission team members are also pinging Opportunity regularly during scheduled “wake-up times” and are listening for a response.
Even if the rover does wake up, it almost certainly won’t get back to its job straight away, the robot has undergone quite a traumatic experience. Steve Squyres, mission scientific principal investigator, said that “it will therefore probably take a few weeks to bring Opportunity out of whatever “fault mode” it has fallen into”.
“It’s either going to be a miraculous recovery, or an honourable death,” Squyres said.
On the up side, all this tempestuous weather surrounding Mars has meant that the red planet has been even more red and clearly visible from Earth, making for some great photo opportunities from around the UK.

17 February 2015 By Antony Lovedale What makes a robot smart?
Traditionally robots have only been able to operate based on set parameters and have been very inflexible to alterations and changes in their working environment, such as an item not being presented correctly. Smart robots have the ability to adapt to these situations and are intelligent enough to respond to changing parameters which enables them to continue to operate as normal. This ‘smart’ ability differentiates this new type of robot from traditional robots and means that automation solutions no longer have to be an exact science which is making the overall process far cheaper.
How can a robot be collaborative?
Until recently the vast majority of robots in industrial environments have had to be caged for the safety of the people who work around them. This is not only for the protection of the worker but also to safeguard the robot for if it where to be moved even fractionally, they wouldn’t be able to compensate for these minor environmental changes and would cease to function as programmed. Collaborative robots represent a whole new breed of robots, where humans can work alongside them, to achieve a common goal. This synergistic relationship portrays collaborative robots as the modern power tool, not here to replace workers or to put people out of work but to enable them to perform their roles more efficiently, increase productivity and reduce the need for offshoring.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PSCTiBi6KY So how about a Smart, Collaborative Robot?
Smart, collaborative robots have the ability to interact and respond to human and robotic co-workers through a variety of communication methods. Robots like the Baxter robot can work alongside people, like humans do , resulting in a similar work process. By utilising low-cost collaborative robotic solutions within a manufacturing environment businesses can save money through an increase in productive, maximisation of efficiency and the re-deployment of staff across more important roles. Smart, collaborative robots can interact not only with co-workers but also with their working environment so that health and safety procedures are the same for human and robot workers alike.
One key attribute to smart, collaborative robots in manufacturing is their ability to change and be re-deployed, with the Baxter Manufacturing Robot this is done be the latest Intera 3 software which uses the unique Robot Positioning System featuring Landmarks™. The Baxter Research Robot uses the latest SDK 1.1 software to maximise its ability to be interchanged between teaching, research and outreach function as a smart, collaborative robot in education .
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aip7aotDxZc What makes Baxter different?
Both versions of the Baxter robot are exactly the same in their technical specification, what makes them different is their software, Intera 3 and SDK 1.1 . Baxter has two seven degree of freedom arms (DOF) with cameras and range finders built into each wrist, end effectors which can easily be interchanged thanks to the open source mounting plate, 360 degree sonar array on its head and Series Elastic Actuators with force torque feedback sensors on each joint. Baxter communicates using the monitor located on its head with eyes displayed, the monitor and the eyes rotate to ‘look’ where it is going to move or operate like humans do. This gives physical signs for human co-workers to interact and work with so that each knows what the other will do. Baxter also features a colour bar on top of its head to show outputs based on working scenarios, such as green for good, amber for needs interaction and red for stopped working. Each of these features alone are impressive enough but built into one platform they create a revolutionary package for both manufacturing and education.
How affordable is the latest in manufacturing technology?
The key question to any business, how much? There are numerous so called ‘collaborative robots’ out there in the market at present but none of these robots are true collaborative robots, they are merely lighter, slower, cageless industrial robots whereas Baxter is a truly smart, collaborative robot. Typical ROI for Baxter in a manufacturing environment is in 12 months but there have been cases where this has been achieved in only 10 months! In education, Universities with Baxter have seen an uptake in student enrolment due to the lure of working with the Baxter robot. Baxter is available in the UK and Europe from £19,000/ 22,000€ and is supplied with a package suited to every users individual requirements.

15 October 2018 By Antony Lovedale Disney’s flying robot stunt double can pose just like a superhero and is being developed for shows at Disney Themeparks. The robots are more like acrobats; they can flip through the air and stick a landing every time.
You may not have thought that Disney would be making advances in the field of robotics, but they have created these lifelike, usually static robots, to entertain crowds at Disney theme parks and resorts. This new breed of animatronics is pushing the limits of robotic engineering, building humanoid robots designed to take part in aerial stunts.
Through the use of laser guiding and built-in accelerometers and gyroscopes, these robots adjust their position in mid-air, perfecting that superhero flight pose. Disney is yet to say exactly where in their theme parks these robots will end up, but you could easily imagine them in costume flying across a stage as a stand in for their human counterpart.
Stuntronics seem to be filling a gap in the repertoire of standard animatronics; they can really convince you that it’s a being of action and dynamism. Quite often robots have a lot of function, yet don’t look quite right when in motion (they are in the “uncanny valley”), but here the opposite is true. Whilst speaking to TechCrunch, Morgan Pope, an Associate Research Scientist at Disney, said that “when a robot is flying through the air physics gives a really neat opportunity that means you can have just a little bit of function to produce a lot of stuff that looks really good.” Maybe Disney is on its way to helping robots leap across the uncanny valley.

Sawyer offers the same highly-touted safety, compliance and usability advantages of Baxter – including the iconic “face” screen, embedded sensors and train-by-demonstration user interface – while providing the smaller footprint and high precision performance needed for tasks that require significant agility and flexibility.  In addition, Sawyer runs on the Intera™ software system, the same extensible platform that powers Baxter, so it works like humans do by dynamically adapting to real-world conditions on the plant floor and integrating seamlessly into existing work cells.  Together, Baxter and Sawyer can address many of the estimated 90 percent of manufacturing tasks that cannot be feasibly automated with traditional solutions today.
Weighing only 19 kg (42 lbs), Sawyer features a 4kg (8.8 lb) payload, with 7 degrees of freedom and a 1-meter reach that can maneuver into the tight spaces and varied alignments of work cells designed for humans.  Its high-resolution force sensing, embedded at each joint, enables Rethink Robotics’ compliant motion control, which allows the robot to “feel” its way into fixtures or machines, even when parts or positions vary.  This enables an adaptive precision that is unique to the robotics industry and allows Sawyer to work effectively in semi-structured environments.  In addition, Sawyer features an embedded vision system, which includes a camera in its head to perform applications requiring a wide field of view and a Cognex camera with a built-in light source in its wrist for precision vision applications.  Sawyer’s vision system enables the Robot Positioning System for dynamic re-orientation, and over time will support more advanced features that are inherent to the Cognex system, such as barcode scanning and object recognition.
“With Baxter, we introduced the concept of robots and people working together on the plant floor,” said Rethink Robotics president and CEO Scott Eckert.  “With Sawyer, we have taken that relationship to the next level, with a high performance robot that opens the door for many new applications that have never been good candidates for automation.  As we continue to redefine this industry, we also continue to give manufacturers new ways of adding efficiency and flexibility into their operations.” Jabil , a global electronic product solutions company that is partnering with Rethink Robotics as an early adopter and field tester of Sawyer, recognizes the robot’s immense potential.  “Flexible automation that addresses shrinking product lifecycles and helps companies align with consumer trends is a critical technology initiative for manufacturers,” said John Dulchinos, vice president of digital manufacturing at Jabil.  “Rethink Robotics continues to lead the way in defining how workers and machines can coexist to leverage the strengths of each, and optimize productivity for all.” Dan Kara, robotics practice director at ABI Research, also sees the value of Sawyer for the robotics industry and its customers.  “With the introduction of Baxter, Rethink fundamentally changed the conversation in the robotics industry and pioneered a new way of thinking about automation.  Today, the collaborative concept has been accepted, the value has been proven, and more companies are looking to standardize globally on these solutions.  Sawyer incorporates advanced technology from the Baxter platform, but is different in other fundamental aspects, making it suitable for wholly new classes of applications.  Rethink’s Sawyer is a very compelling technology that has the potential to once again change the way manufacturers think about their automation infrastructure moving forward,” he concluded.
Sawyer, which will retail for a base price of $29,000, will initially be available in North America, Europe, China and Japan. It is currently being field tested by several large manufacturing companies in those regions.  Sawyer will be released with limited availability in the summer of 2015, with general customer availability targeted for later in the year.  For more information, visit rethinkrobotics.com .

01 October 2018 By Antony Lovedale Active8 Robots has developed optional extras available for the software behind the successful Attollo Palletiser. This now allows the technical staff, here at Active8 Robots, to be given remote access to the palletiser wherever it is working in the world. We can now, when needed, view the client’s control panel on our screen, which allows the Active8 Robots technical staff to mirror the teach pendant. This means the support we can now offer with the Palletiser is exceptional- any questions or queries? You won’t need to try and explain it over the phone, instead we can simply take a look for ourselves.
Don’t have much space in your factory? That shouldn’t be a problem either. Attollo is a compact and portable automated palletiser, with a footprint of only 2m X 2.2m. Furthermore, the ease of relocation means it offers speed and flexibility when setting up your production line. On top of this, the Attollo reduces labour costs and lowers health and safety risks associated with manual handling. It’s also safe to use as it is fully guarded, with pallet entry and box infeed light guarded for ease of access. A graphical User Interface (GUI) is also built into the Attollo Palletiser to give an ease of use for any beginner. With this interface complex pallet layers can be configured without specialist programming knowledge, in order to make the most out of the space you have. Boxes can then be rotated and nudged to create a custom layer pattern.
This optional extra software for the Attollo Palletiser which means that now not only can we can offer you remote support, but that you can optimise production through the reports and performance timelines generated by the software.
If you would like to hear more about how the Attollo Palletiser could work for you then don’t hesitate to contact us. Either give us a ring on 01761 234376 or email us at [email protected] .

The edition is entitled “50 Amazing Innovations changing how we live”.
The chosen innovations in the Time Magazine edition were selected based on various aspects. These included originality, creativity, influence, ambition and effectiveness. Finally, all of them had to have one main characteristic; they are ground-breaking inventions that change people’s lives. Furthermore, they influence our perception of what is possible.
Of course, Active8 Robots was already aware of how innovative the Panda is. However, it’s amazing to see this credit being given by such a renowned body.
The Time Magazine article states: “we’re living in the middle of a robotics revolution, but the most capable machines are generally available only to wealthy corporations. The German-based robotics firm Franka Emika is changing that with the Panda , an $11,000 (roughly) easy-to-program robotic arm designed for small businesses. Able to move in seven axes and designed with a smart sense of “touch,” the Panda can help conduct science experiments, build circuit boards or pretest equipment. Two Panda arms can even work together to build a third. And while the Panda isn’t designed for personal use, something similar could eventually offer a helping hand at home. It could chop food in the kitchen or assist the elderly with difficult tasks. “We believe that robots will have a similar success story as personal computers,” says Franka Emika’s CEO and co-founder, Simon Haddadin.

The company’s focus is on “collaborative robotics” — that is, using robots in workplace situations where they are nearby and working with humans.
Robotiq was founded in 2008 by Bouchard and Laval University classmates Vincent Duchaine and Jean-Philippe Jobin. Starting a business in this time meant hitting the financial crisis, which provided some challenges for the company. “It was not the best time but things got better. Our first product didn’t work that well. But the second one did,” he said.
Today, Robotiq announced its first institutional funding — a CAD$31 million (USD$23 million) raise from Boston-based venture capital (VC) firm Battery Ventures. The company said it will use the money to boost its product development efforts and grow its business globally. As part of the investment, Battery Ventures partner Jesse Feldman will join Robotiq’s board.
“We have been tracking Robotiq and its experienced team for several years and are extremely impressed with the business the founders have built,” Feldman said. “Robotiq’s next-generation products are improving efficiencies at companies all over the globe and, more broadly, provide a glimpse of how new, interconnected technologies, including robots, sensors, and software, are driving a new kind of industrial revolution with huge ramifications for the global economy and workforce.” “Collaborative robotics is transforming industries today, offering low-cost, easy-to-deploy solutions that stand in stark contrast to the more-complicated, legacy robotics systems of the past,” added Robotiq cofounder and CEO Samuel Bouchard. “What is amazing about these systems is how they work side by side with humans to improve quality, increase efficiency, and minimize worker injuries.” Active8 Robots is a leading innovator of automated solutions that incorporate collaborative robots, if you think these solutions could help improve productivity within your business then contact us today!

We all know robots have been around for a long time used in a variety of industrial processes, such as those used by car manufacturers to streamline their assembly process and improve productivity. These industrial robots are super-fast, accurate and can be scaled to suit almost any task, however they take time to implement by specialist integrators and as a consequence are expensive and inflexible to changes in their working environment.
But unlike traditional industrial robots, collaborative robots, often referred to as cobots or co-robots are used in lighter, slower, repetitive manually handling tasks that would usually be carried out by people. Often these unstimulating repetitive tasks can be trained into a cobot by the line operative without any specialist knowledge freeing the operative to do more rewarding work.
What about the media hype that robots will take jobs?
Well companies have been manufacturing industrial robots for decades to do just that, fuelled by other companies wanting to reduce costs and increase profitability. However, there is an opportunity with the introduction of collaborative robots to improve the lot of operatives carrying out, dull, repetitive, often sole destroying tasks, that are best suited to robots. The new breed of cobots work alongside trained operatives who tend the cobots and in our experience are embraced by line operatives and employers alike.
We need to work smarter and invent new ways of doing things and absolutely embrace new technology that historically has shown over time improves all our lives and leads to better living standards. Smart people use smart tools to do their work more efficiently, smart cobots are just another tool to help us achieve more, improve working conditions, while improving safety in the work place.
How do collaborative robots improve safety?
The unique safety characteristics of collaborative robots mean that people can work alongside cobots within a defined area without caging; where the collaborative robot and human can perform tasks together simultaneously. There is quite a lot required to achieve this, power and force limiting, force monitoring and an assessment of the task and environment needs to be considered. Active8 Robots can help determine the suitability of a cobot for any given task and provide any necessary compliance documentation and CE certification.
So, what is a smart collaborative robot?
All cobots are not created equal, most have six axis or degrees of freedom unlike a human arm that has seven degrees or freedom. Also most cobots don’t include integrated vision and task oriented force feedback, meaning its often necessary to spend considerably more on external accessories supplied by third party vendors. However, there is one collaborative robot that has a seven-axis arm, fully integrated vison system, force feedback that can be used in tasks requiring manual dexterity.

05 February 2018 By Antony Lovedale There are many industries that are put off by the idea of automation because they want to retain the human touch, in our experience, many companies find that the deployment of robotic process automation provides efficiency improvements, business growth and the automating of dirty, dangerous and dull tasks leaves staff to use their creativity and intelligence to better serve their customers.
Imagine having your process efficiency improved by 30% or more by reducing the number of menial tasks your staff perform on a daily basis. Free up your time to concentrate on the tasks that matter most.
Collaborative robots are perfect for day to day automation of repetitive tasks and being ‘collaborative’, they are able to safely work alongside humans, assisting in their daily duties and improving productivity.
The concept of using robots in any industry that relies on customer-driven satisfaction might seem a bit out there, but in fact, they are ideal for those companies that continually strive to meet their customer’s demands and need to go the extra mile to maintain customer satisfaction levels. Collaborative robots help get your processes more dynamic, automating mundane tasks gives your staff more time to work towards providing the best customer experience.
Use of technology such as Cobots, could improve working conditions and allow people to be more involved with the complex and creative decision making that humans are far better suited to and make businesses stand out. In the fast-paced world of instant gratification that we’ve come to rely on with social media, smartphones and even takeaways that promise to be with you within minutes, why doesn’t this mentality prevail in industry?

The UK has a large and important pharmaceutical industry but it’s work has to be competitive on a world stage. For facilities to remain relevant and address the productivity shortfalls faced by British companies, technological advances like the latest Collaborative Robots for the pharmaceutical industry are a vital innovation.  This means that, for production and research labs alike, Collaborative Robots (Cobots) are becoming commonplace and are now becoming the norm working alongside humans.
Here’s the top five reasons the UK Pharmaceutical Industry is embracing this technology.
Labour costs continue to rise in the UK, most sectors have not addressed the issue.  Most Cobots come in at a fraction of the cost of a salary, typically offering a return of investment of 6-8 months.  Meanwhile in China, the costs of labour is a fraction of ours but they have recognised that collaborative robots are so important to productivity that they encouraging businesses to install them with cash subsidies (more on this subject here ).
Collaborative Robots can attend to tasks 24 hours a day, bringing down the cost and time to bring drugs to market.  See our main Pharmaceutical Industry page here .
Safety. These robots are designed to work alongside people.  They use sensor technology to to operate safely in a similar footprint with their human colleagues.
Flexibility. Even the smallest of labs can use a robot for a multitude of tasks, easily programmed and reprogrammed without expertise.  When they’re done with the robot, it can be wheeled to another lab.
Governance is easy with Robots. They can record details automatically, their actions are fully verifiable, human error is being eliminated from processes and tracking is simple.
That’s the basic reasons that these robots for the pharmaceutical industry are becoming ubiquitous in any pharmaceutical team, find out more information and facts about robotics in this industry on our Pharmaceutical Industry page here .

Take Franka Emika for example, the simplicity of this “human assistant” is unheard-of in the robot industry. It is delivered in one box and set up in 15 minutes, moving cobots from something out of reach to something totally accessible. Another newcomer to the market is Automata with Eva, an affordable robot arm that is built for professionals. Eva can also be set up in just 15 minutes, and weighs just 8kg.
These new Cobots, combined with the developments that companies such as FANUC are making, mean that there are more possibilities than ever when it comes to automation. FANUC recently released a Cobot that can carry a 35kg payload, something previously unheard of in the cobot world, but now it seems there is nothing holding us back.
We use a multitude of different types of robots in our automation solutions and have strong relationships with the majority of the major robot and cobot manufacturers, meaning we can design the exact solution that best suits your needs.
Whether it’s a high payload or a small footprint that you need, we have a robot that will work for you. And we don’t just stop at the robots. We can also integrate a wide range of systems into your solution, be it a vision system or a specific software, if your solution needs it then we can integrate it.
So whatever your specific needs may be, don’t hesitate to talk to us about how we could help you on your automation journey. With the wide range of robots available to us, we will be able to make the exact automation solution you need. We are not biased towards any particular brand and so through the implementation of cross platform robot bench-marking we can ensure the robot selected is the perfect one for you.

However, with the development of low-cost robotics offshoring is not only happening less, but reshoring is increasingly happening.
What is offshoring and reshoring?
Offshoring is the relocation, by a company, of a business process from one country to another—typically an operational process, such as manufacturing, to a country where wage and operating costs are lower. This typically happens for manual factory processes where labour costs are the main expenditure for the business. A usual rationale for offshoring is that by moving low-skilled manufacturing jobs overseas, then higher skilled research and development jobs can be kept locally therefore keeping innovation and technology at its best.
Reshoring is the process of bringing back the work which was previously offshored and this can happen for a number of reasons, whether for financial, quality or ethical purposes. With increasing Asian labour rates, consumer demand for ethically produced goods and the subsequent exposure of exploited workers working in poor conditions there has been an increase in work being returned to the UK. The first to do so was the telecoms industry with numerous call centres returning to the UK due to popular consumer demand because of low quality.
Why the demand for reshoring?
Due to increasing labour rates (18% in China a year, 500% in the last 12 years), miscalculation of the Total Cost of Ownership and consumer demand for ethically produced, carbon friendly products offshoring is decreasing and there is a growing trend for reshoring. With the development of low cost collaborative robots, such as the Baxter Manufacturing Robot , businesses can bring manufacturing work back to their domestic market through cost effective robots which can deliver return on investment in as little as 12 months. It is becoming increasingly apparent to businesses throughout the world that their grand plan to offshore and save money wasn’t quite the cost saving honeypot they had imagined it to be. In 2010 Harry Moser created the Reshoring Initiative to bring manufacturing jobs back to the USA through the realisation that offshoring may not be all it seems. By localising production and sourcing manufacturers can often reduce their Total Cost of Ownership of purchased parts and tooling and that through reshoring, manufacturing in the United States is starting to gain momentum. You can work out your Total Cost of Ownership at www.reshorenow.org .
How can smart, collaborative robots help?
Smart, collaborative robots such as the Baxter Robot can seamlessly integrate alongside existing staff, without the need for safety cages, time consuming and costly programming and they also cut out the need for extensive health and safety red tape reviews and training. These co-bots (collaborative robots), are intelligent and can adapt to their surroundings, react safely to the presence of humans and have in-built safety mechanisms conforming to ISO 10218 so they won’t be featured on next week’s episode of Bad Robots.
The Baxter Manufacturing Robot can be used to perform menial, labour intensive tasks to exacting standards time and time again, freeing up staff to perform other functions within the business to make best use of existing resources.
With a low starting cost of £19,000/ 22,000€ the Baxter Robot isn’t a massive investment and can quickly provide a return on investment. Although technically a co-worker, Baxter doesn’t need coffee breaks, holidays, get sick or require a pension scheme contribution so is productive 100% of the time. Baxter has been documented in the USA to have worked 2,160 continuous hours and can easily be redeployed across tasks without the need for expensive, time consuming re-programming.
The Baxter Robot by Rethink Robotics is available now in the UK and Europe through Active8 Robots at www.active8robots.com.gridhosted.co.uk .

02 May 2019 By Antony Lovedale When is the right time to invest in automation? The answer is now and here’s why.
“Make hay while the sun shines” is an enduring proverb in the English language, known to be used since the mid 1500s and similar to sentiments in the bible, the phrase is so powerful because it’s as true today, as it was back then. Of course, automation has made ‘making hay’ so much swifter, so if the storm clouds start brewing on the horizon you can take action.
What storm?
I can remember a few economic downturns and recessions over the years and they all had one thing in common. When they hit, we hadn’t realised that times were so good. Looking out to the horizon today we can certainly see some heavy clouds building. The Chinese, European and US home economies are all slowing down. According to CBS Business news, US investors are reducing their interests in government bonds in favour of shorter term investments. Harvard business review and others are beginning to talk about a small economic downturn in 2020.
So stop spending on Automation right? Wrong!
In any economic down turn, there are winners and losers, but those that win, make a habit of it. According to the Harvard Business Review, companies that focus on cost cutting without thinking about growth will not outperform the market.
How will your company not only weather any impending storm, but continue to grow?
Taking a long term view by investing now in automation, will inevitably make your company more lean and competitive. When times are tough, it is these companies that continue to win business while the weak and inefficient lose.
Our top tips for being prepared, whatever the economic outlook “Before everything else, getting ready is the secret of success.” Henry Ford Invest in growth.
A downturn may make short term growth difficult but you can still protect your long term goals.
“Some habits of ineffectiveness are rooted in our social conditioning toward quick-fix, short-term thinking.” Stephen Covey Focus on your technological competitiveness.
More productivity and efficiency, greater resilience and ability to respond to opportunities that arise.
“The best way to predict the future is to create it.” Peter Drucker Don’t lose sight of your long-term goals.
A downturn is an opportunity to help you win the business lost by the weak and inefficient. These are the cheapest times to grow by acquisition too. Get prepared to take advantage.
“Someone is sitting in the shade today because someone planted a tree a long time ago.” Warren Buffett If you’re unsure of where or how to automate, or how robotics can help in your processes, call today we’ll help you find the right places to get started.

UK companies have always found competing with China difficult with their low labour costs but beware China is becoming even more productive by using Collaborative Robots and the UK should be too.
The latest figures from the International Federation of Robotics show that China is increasing its expenditure on production robots year on year. They now fit a third of the worlds new Robots in their factories, supporting capital outlay with cash payments. That’s over twice the number of the next highest the USA, who in turn fit almost twice the annual number being installed in factories in the whole of Europe.
The fact is that much has changed in this field in just the few years here are the top 5 Headline reasons why you should probably be using Collaborative Robots NOW for your assembly and packing tasks.
Safety -Modern Collaborative Robots are safe to operate with and around factory workers they use AI and sensory technology to keep your workforce safe without the need for large areas of workshop space with caging and safety screens.
Cost -Some of the best, most up to date Collaborative Robots come in under £30,000 most estimating an ROI of 6 to 8 months.
More flexible than ever -You could get a super flexible Collaborative Robot for your business, which your team or ours can teach in minutes, without any expertise to carry out a task in your workshop and when its done, you can wheel it elsewhere to do another task.
Reduce Downtime – These robots can plod on maintenance free 24 hours a day for years and years on end.
Reduce Mistakes – Even your most loyal and diligent factory worker can make a mistake when carrying out repetitive and brain numbing tasks. Robots perform every task to the same standard.
If UK SMEs are to be able to remain competitive on a global or even a local market, now is the time to for this small, inexpensive, reliable and flexible workforce to be put to work.  Why not take a look at Active8 Robots’ Sawyer Robot as a possible solution for you?

The AI-enabled robot was called before a Commons Committee to give evidence on the future of technology in society. “This is not about someone bringing an electronic toy robot and doing a demonstration,” said Committee chair Robert Halfon. ‘It’s about showing the potential of robotics and artificial intelligence and the impact it has on skills.’ Pepper is part of an international research project developing the world’s first culturally aware robots aimed at assisting with care for older people and in STEM education. The Committee heard about her work with students across the faculties at Middlesex University, including a project involving teaching primary level children, and what role increased automation and robotics might play in the workplace and classroom of the future.
Automation in the Workplace The Committee first questioned a panel of experts on the suitability of the current school curriculum, and how life long learning should interlink with the 4 th Industrial Revolution. Pepper reassured her questioners, insisting that humans will never be made obsolete because we have “soft-skills” that robots cannot reproduce. It was discussed during the committee that re-skilling and upskilling should be important in the future, but that ensuring this requires the right collaboration between bosses and workers. It was also said that our culture around learning should change, and we should no longer accept that the learning process finishes with your education, but instead that learning is a life-long process. This comes with the idea that technology will never stop changing and improving; we need to change and adapt with it.
Further to this it was mentioned that the workers at the “bottom” may be the most affected as it is their jobs that are said to be being replaced by autonomy, however it was argued that there are robots being developed to perform brain surgery and defuse bombs. One panel member it was possible that these will be the jobs affected as these are the jobs where the higher salary can be saved. It all depends on whether the infrastructure and technology are worth investing in, and this is something that will only be known with time. Although automation will grow to become a big part of our future, it is humans who need to drive value from this new technology; a new way of thinking is needed by tomorrow’s workers.
Robotics in STEM Education The idea of how lessons should be taught were also discussed; whether resources like Pepper were worth investing in to be present in the classroom. It was explained that Robots like Pepper are not just a means of engaging students but that there is a deeper level of learning to be had through making subjects practical and interactive. This notion of embodied learning was said to be an area that should be built upon, as with the development of modern technology comes opportunity for tactile and sensory feedback. Furthermore, they discussed that the subject of computing shouldn’t just be seen as “typing on a keyboard with a screen” but that it should be about driver-less cars, and phones and cameras.
The panel from Middlesex University said that learning should be more about problem solving and exploring than it should about memorising and regurgitating information. It was discussed that the performance-based approach is causing failure to become the norm, and that instead we should be taught to ask ourselves, “we may have failed, but what have we learned?”.
It was stated by one of the teachers on the committee that having something like Pepper in the classroom would be an extra challenge for them; something extra to learn and something extra to set up in the morning. However, this was quickly rebuffed by the witnesses, who explained that if it is going to improve a child’s education, then it should be worth it for the teacher. On top of this, by the time a child gets to year 5 or 6 it will probably be the case that they’ll be able to program the robot for the teacher. This comes back to the idea that we should stop celebrating ignorance; teachers and workers alike should be committed to this lifelong learning in order to keep up with technology and the world around us.
Women in STEM A final subject that was broached in the discussion was women in STEM careers. One of the panel said  “women in stem is something that we want, that inequality needs to be removed… equal performance should lead to equal opportunities”. Joana Miranda, a student studying Robotics Engineering at Middlesex University followed on to say that we need to get rid of the stigma around women in Engineering.

“It became clear that we could do some things a lot better with a different sort of arm.” – Rodney Brooks Sawyer has many things in common with Baxter, but there are also major differences. Sawyer is a single-arm, high-performance robot designed to execute machine tending, circuit board testing and other precise tasks that have historically been impractical to automate with traditional industrial robots. Sawyer is built around the same series elastic actuator technology used in Baxter, which keeps it inherently safe, but the actuators have been redesigned using titanium “S” springs. Sawyer’s casing has also been changed, high performance Aluminium has replaced the plastic casing found on Baxter. These innovative design changes allows Sawyer’s arm to be considerably smaller than Baxter. Rodney Brooks said the arm’s seven degrees of freedom and 1-metre reach open up new a whole range of applications that Baxter is just not designed for. “The arm can just snake right in there,” he said.
Rodney Brooks with Sawyer and Baxter With the advancement of technology in Sawyer it will be priced at $29,000 (around £25,000 at time of release) which is still cheaper than many products on the market and keeps ROI in less than 12 months.
“Baxter has done really well in certain kinds of tasks, like taking stuff off a line, or packing boxes,” said Rethink chief marketing officer Jim Lawton. “The feedback we’ve gotten from customers has been, ‘We want to do more stuff the way Baxter does stuff, but we want to do it in other kinds of tasks.’ And those other kinds of tasks require a robot to be able to perform a little bit differently.” Sawyer – Priced at $29,000 / £25,000 Technical specs: Weight: 19 kg (42 lbs) Payload: 4 kg (8.8 lb) Reach: 7 degrees of freedom and 1-meter reach Actuation: Series elastic actuator and Harmonic Drive, with optical encoder Repeatability: N/A Force sensing: High-resolution force sensing embedded at each joint Vision: Camera in the head for wide field of view and Cognex camera with built-in light source in the wrist for precision vision applications Software: Intera, with software updates every 4 months Body: Sealed against dust and spray [Baxter isn’t] Expected lifetime: 30,000 hours Price: US $29,000 (available in North America, Europe, China, and Japan) Sawyer Technical Datasheet PDF With rising labour costs around the world , particularly in the Far East, manufacturers are increasing looking for other ways to reduce production costs. Smart, collaborative robots like Sawyer and Baxter can provide businesses with a low cost, flexible solution which can provide ROI in less that 12 months! Baxter has proved the concept of smart, collaborative robot manufacturing within the US and now Sawyer will take this concept Worldwide.
Offshoring has long been a headache for businesses and an ever increasing worry for workers who fear the their jobs are going to lost to cheap overseas labour. Through utilising low cost collaborative robotic solutions manufacturing can be kept domestically and a trend of reshoring can commence.
Rethink Robotics have taken valuable lessons from Baxter and listened to early adopters to reduce the size of Sawyer to fit into a 2 x 2 x 5 foot area. This kind of area represents the standard space for a human on a tightly packed assembly line, which was something Baxter just couldn’t do!

Sawyer has a limited number of sensors; in talking with clients about potential applications, Rethink decided to focus on what would be most useful. The biggest upgrade is the wrist camera, which is now a Cognex with a built-in light source, repositioned so that it won’t be occluded by large grippers. Other than that, there’s just one more camera on Sawyer’s head, and of course all of the series elastic actuators can sense forces very accurately. This allows the robot to do more delicate tasks, and also maintain the level of intrinsic safety that made Baxter a robot that humans could work around, even if it accidentally hits them.
Sawyer runs Rethink’s ROS-based software platform Intera and also features the same interactive control system as Baxter, with just a few tweaks to the interface. You can still teach the robot to do simple tasks just by grabbing it by the wrist and showing it once, and it’ll adapt to minor changes in its environment without any additional input.
Rethink have “signed contracts for hundreds of robots” already within the USA, the first International units are expected to ship by the end of 2015.

Built on the backbone of the industry’s best train-by-demonstration software that powers the world’s fastest-to-deploy robots, Intera 5 is paving the way for connected manufacturing environments and helping companies build factories of the future. Intera 5 fundamentally changes the need for integration, making it substantially easier and more affordable, allowing manufacturers to deploy full work cell automation in a matter of hours, not weeks.
Intera 5 is much more than the latest version of Rethink Robotics’ software; it’s a new way to approach automation that allows manufacturers to control the robots, orchestrate the work cell and collect data.
“With the introduction of Intera 5, we’ve created the world’s first smart robot that can orchestrate the entire work cell, removing areas of friction and opening up new and affordable automation possibilities for manufacturers around the world,” said Scott Eckert, president and CEO, Rethink Robotics. “Intera 5 is driving immediate value while helping customers work toward a smart factory, and providing a gateway to successful industrial internet of things (IIoT) for the first time.” Consumer expectations for greater personalization and shifting market demands require manufacturers to be innovative and agile while still controlling costs. Rethink Robotics’ Intera 5 modernizes the traditional work cell by improving coordination, increasing flexibility and drastically reducing deployment times. Run through the robot’s controller, manufacturers can orchestrate conveyors, equipment and other machines from a central Intera 5-powered robot.
Tuthill Plastics Group , a full-service custom injection molding company, is using a Sawyer robot with Intera 5 to power improved product quality and more efficient production. Operating 24 hours a day, five days a week, Sawyer with Intera 5 is picking parts from a conveyor belt and communicating with a computer numeric control (CNC) machine to precisely place the part into the machine by using Intera 5’s unique force-sensing capabilities. By applying a precise level of force while placing the part, the Tuthill team has been able to improve part quality and consistency, reducing a length defect on the part by 98 percent since implementing Sawyer.
“Sawyer with Intera 5 is a major step forward in manufacturing automation,” said Richard Curtain, president, Tuthill Plastics Group. “Part placement is extremely critical to our machining process. Sawyer is able to effectively ensure product quality and consistency, handle the variability of the production line, and automatically re-register to the environment in the event that any parts move.” German magnet manufacturer, MS Schramberg , is also leveraging Sawyer with Intera 5 and has substantially improved deployment time. With six robots operating on three machines, MS Schramberg has one robot selecting parts from a series of patterns and loading the part into the machine, while a second robot removes the part from the machine and loads the part into a tray.
With less than a day of training, an MS Schramberg engineer is able to deploy and train the robots in just more than an hour. The robots now run 24 hours per day, six days per week, and can easily configure complex logic tasks, minimizing the need for human interaction and freeing up employees for more complex tasks.
“We’ve cut our deployment times by hundreds of hours with Intera 5, and are able to easily deploy our Sawyer robots on an extremely complex task in just over an hour,” said Norman Wittke, general manager, MS Schramberg. “The ease and speed of deployment is extremely valuable for our company, and is helping make our manufacturing processes more efficient, while improving our ROI.” With Intera 5, manufacturers will reap the benefits of: Industry-leading embedded vision , which will allow the robot to perform tasks just as humans do, reducing the need for expensive part presentation fixturing and additional integration costs.
Adaptive force-sensing , allowing users to precisely set the amount of force required, or enable the robot to feel and respond to a specific force, so the robot can make adaptive decisions while performing a task.
Intera Studio, an intuitive and powerful new tool to simply and effectively deploy automation like never before, providing a gateway to the factory of the future.
“Intera 5 is equipping industry leaders like Tuthill Plastics and MS Schramberg to achieve immediate bottom-line improvements in productivity, quality and efficiency on the factory floor,” said Eckert. “By implementing our robots equipped with Intera 5, manufacturers will have unprecedented work cell coordination, greatly reducing the need for complex, time-consuming and outdated automation options.” Rethink Robotics provides a proven path for manufacturers to build connected work cells today, delivering immediate benefits without disrupting production needs.
Beginning in March, Intera 5 will be available for download on all existing Sawyer robots, and will come standard on all new robots. For more information visit rethinkrobotics.com .

04 January 2018 By Antony Lovedale A new report from the Institute of Fiscal Studies suggests that raising the minimum wage will make workers unaffordable and push more businesses to automation. In industries where this is already happening, the use of new technology replacing low skilled jobs created other relevant jobs and workers could be upskilled as a result of higher wages, which in turn produced a more efficient workforce. Over time, progress and innovation have made industry more efficient and the workplace a safer, more enjoyable place to be.
If wages do rise at the rate that is predicted, it is likely that many businesses will find it difficult to afford the workers needed and with the quick turn around on ROI, especially in the collaborative robot market, and the already reported skills shortage, it makes sense to start automating the dangerous, dull and dirty tasks.
The UK is currently one of the least automated when it comes to manufacturing and with Brexit predictions stating that many workers will be leaving come 2019, perhaps these changes in the workforce should be welcomed rather than feared?

Why NAO?
We chose the NAO Humanoid robot to deliver our STEM Workshops as it is the most versatile platform to deliver STEM education as well as offering the best value for schools and businesses. The NAO robot is used throughout education, starting at KS1, it is an engaging platform for students to learn, develop and play with. NAO is currently being used by numerous universities throughout the world for research projects meaning that students can continue learning using one robotic platform.
What’s covered in our STEM Workshops?
Our STEM workshops and assemblies are tailored to your own particular needs, levels and experience. The outline of our STEM workshop typically comprises of a robot presentation, discussion about technology changes,  the use of robots in today’s society as well as what the future holds for the field of robotics and why it’s so important for students to develop their STEM skills. Students are encouraged to think about how they are used to enhance our world now and in the future and their own future career possibilities could benefit from robotics. Students then experience computer programming by creating programs for our NAO robots to perform at the end of the session and discuss their work and achievements.

10 September 2018 By Antony Lovedale Barclays’ Future-Proofing UK Manufacturing report states that “ 65% of British Manufacturers say their productivity has increased as a result of automation” and “ 54% say automation allows more time for staff to complete other tasks” . This shows that the use of robots in the work place doesn’t replace the human workforce, but instead frees them up to complete more meaningful tasks. On top of this the report states that the “ successful implementation of automation works to create more jobs with higher salaries”.
Instead of being overly concerned that robots are “taking their jobs”, workers should be excited about the new training opportunities that may become available to them. Many employers will offer job training to give valuable workers new skill sets. In many cases even, automated processes and humans can co-exist. Robots are especially good at repetitive actions; they won’t get tired or make mistakes. They are also better at doing two separate actions at once. But all of this should be embraced. Whilst the robots are doing the boring work, workers are freed up to do more fulfilling and engaging tasks. Furthermore, with the extra training that may become available, workers will have more opportunities for higher earnings.
“Those manufacturing businesses that are investing in automation report that they are seeing clear benefits”.
Respected voices in the technology industry have also declared that automation will “improve our lives”. Dyson founder Sir James Dyson is one of these people, who believes that automation will boost employment opportunities for skilled engineers. He says that “instead of replacing worker’s jobs, it will boost employment as skilled engineers and IT experts are needed to develop this new technology”.
Robotic Process Automation (RPA) is essential for companies to stay ahead of the competition, and keep employees excited about their job roles, making it critical to the future success of the business. In this way companies should be able to free employees from the boring and repetitive manual tasks that reduce productivity and allow them to make forward-thinking decisions that will ultimately benefit the bottom line.

We’ve already had numerous emails and calls from people asking all about Sawyer, but other than the colour being the same as Baxter, how else do Sawyer and Baxter compare? Let’s take a look….
Similarities Firstly, Baxter and Sawyer are both ‘Rethink Red’ and this is the thing people are quick to point out first.
They both adapt to real world variability in semi structured environments, are able to change applications quickly providing flexible automation to all users.
Both robots work like humans do to provide a collaborative human-robot working environment.
Sawyer has been built to reflect the same low cost principles that Rodney Brooks envisioned for Baxter and will provide ROI typically within 12 months.
Series Elastic Actuators are used in both robots to provide the inherent safety features that make Rethink Robotics Robots unique.
Intera powers both Baxter and Sawyer meaning that what is learnt with Baxter can be applied and transferred to Sawyer.
Neither robot requires caging as they fall within the safety parameters of ISO 10218, the International Standard for collaborative robots.
Differences Whereas Baxter is a humanoid robot with 2 arms with 7 degrees of freedom (DOF), a torso and a head, Sawyer only has one arm with 7 degrees of freedom (DOF) and no separate body.
There is a higher payload of 4 kg with Sawyer as opposed to 2.2 kg with Baxter and Sawyer itself will weigh only 19 kg.
Sawyer is more precise than Baxter and also has better repeatability, this is partly due to new zero backlash gear boxes and harmonic drive motors being used.
Smaller and more compact than Baxter which makes Sawyer ideal for machine tending and line handling work as it can fit comfortably alongside human co-workers.
Sawyer will also be certified for global markets so will be implementable Worldwide Want to meet Baxter or Sawyer in person?
We can come to you at a time to suit you and let our robots give you a personal presentation.

As part of National Robotics Week Active8 Robots will be delivering a series of lectures on collaborative robotics via Skype to students across Europe. Most Universities have nothing within their current syllabus on collaborative robotics so we’ve decided that to drive further interest in the field of collaborative robotics through our commitment to education and industry we will provide these lectures at no charge.
Traditional industrial robots have been around for a number of years but have provided few opportunities and sparked little interest in students to pursue a career in industrial automation. However, with the collaborative robotics revolution there are an increasing number of employment opportunities for graduates and industries are now starting to realise the true potential that collaborative robots present. By working with industry partners and Universities we hope to provide students with the best possible education so that they can be at the forefront of the collaborative robotics revolution that is going to change manufacturing in the Western World.
Through utilising low cost collaborative automation robots like Baxter and Sawyer, manufacturers can increase flexibility and productivity to reduce the need to offshore and keep their domestic workforce. Modern power tools like Baxter and Sawyer can actually lead to a growing trend of reshoring where workers are empowered to become more productive and more highly trained.
Now more than ever there is an increasing focus on STEM subject education, particularly with regards to encouraging the participation of girls and young women, and from our experience we’ve found that robotics is an area which attracts all students to STEM based education.
Want to arrange your free lecture?
We can arrange a free Skype lecture to show you why smart, collaborative robots are the future for European manufacturing.

Full press release from Rethink Robotics : “Rethink Robotics today unveiled the Sawyer™ Software Development Kit (SDK), a software upgrade designed for researchers and students to build and test programs on the Sawyer robot. With a wide range of uses for university research teams and corporate R&D laboratories around the world, Sawyer SDK offers further compatibility with ROS and state-of-art Open Source robotics tools, as well as an affordable solution to increase access to advanced robotics in the classroom.
Sawyer SDK includes several advanced features that allow users to visualize and control how the robot interacts with its environment. Sawyer SDK now integrates with the popular Gazebo Simulator, which creates a simulated world that will visualize the robot and its contact with the environment, allowing researchers to run and test code in the simulation before running it on the robot. Sawyer’s Gazebo integration is completely open source, allowing students to run simulations from their individual laptops without a robot until they’re ready to test the code in real time. This approach allows professors to provide students with access to the industry-leading collaborative robot.
In addition to the Gazebo integration, Sawyer SDK includes a new motion interface that allows researchers to program the robot in Cartesian space. This development lowers the barriers for motion planning for programmers without a full robotics background. The new release also allows researchers to leverage new impedance and force control. Sawyer SDK also includes support for ClickSmart™, the family of gripper kits that Rethink announced in 2017 to create a fully integrated robotic solution.
“Rethink’s robots are used in the world’s leading research institutions, which provides us with a wealth of feedback on what our research customers really want,” said Scott Eckert, president and CEO, Rethink Robotics. “As we have with all of our SDK releases, we’re continuing to set the standard in research with industry-leading features that allow universities and corporate labs to push the field of robotics forward and publish their research faster.” Sawyer SDK is being piloted in robotics programs at multiple universities, including Stanford University, University of California at Berkeley, Georgia Institute of Technology and Northwestern University.
Stanford’s Vision and Learning Lab works on endowing robots with diverse skills for both industrial and day-to-day personal robotics applications.
“Robotics is a field that combines technological and engineering skills with creativity, and the inventiveness our students have shown so far with the robots has been astounding,” said Dr. Animesh Garg, postdoctoral researcher in the Stanford University department of computer science. Animesh and his team of researchers have put Sawyer to use executing tasks directly from virtual reality (VR) input using automatic decomposition in simpler activities. Sawyer is also used for ongoing work in learning to use simple tools, such as hammers and screwdrivers.
Stanford University’s Experimental Robotics class allows students to think beyond day-to-day industrial tasks. They’ve trained Sawyer to draw, and track moving targets and hovering drones. Rethink’s Sawyer has enabled faster learning curves for researchers and students alike, making it easier than ever with the Sawyer SDK release.
The SDK will be available on all Sawyer robots, allowing access to both the Intera manufacturing software and the SDK software, starting in March 2018.

Smart, collaborative robots are autonomous robots which can work safely alongside human co-workers and have to be tested to meet ISO 10218-1 and ISO 10218-2 standards, they are sometimes known as CoBots. These standards ensure that the robots are safe to work alongside humans and so don’t require safety cages which make them far more flexible to work with, and also easier and cheaper to implement.
Typical misconceptions about collaborative robots Many people have been led to believe that robots are going to take their job and that by implementing robots within a workforce will cause job losses and/ or lack of new job creation, however this is not the case. In fact, the introduction of collaborative robots is causing the opposite to happen.
Offshoring is becoming far more costly for businesses and so they are now looking at reshoring through low-cost robotic solutions to return manufacturing back to domestic markets. Visit www.reshorenow.org to calculate your cost of offshoring and the savings your company could make through reshoring.
How can Active8 Robots help?
Firstly, we help companies by solving problems with collaborative manufacturing robots . Many manufacturers come to us looking for help with a specific problem, whether to increase efficiency, reduce costs or simply to increase productivity we can help by providing a low cost robotic solution. We work closely with manufacturers, from start to finish with their project, and make sure we cater not only for the needs of the business, but also for the end user of our robotic solution. Our robotic solutions are tailored to each individual business and we provide the highest level of support to businesses.
Do you have a Robotic Manufacturing Solution for your business?
Many businesses think their operation is perfectly efficient, but what do their staff think? Are they tired of performing the same monotonous task 9 hours a day, does this sometimes lead to production quality issues or staff retention problems? Collaborative robots are the perfect solution meaning that employees can be re-deployed within the business so that their skills are better utilised, they can even learn to train the robot further adding to their skill set.
Below is an example of a problem which we are currently working on. The client has asked us to automate a process to increase efficiency and to allow the re-deployment of staff within the business and this is our initial proof of concept video. We are now working with the client to integrate this robotic solution within their existing production line.

In addition, he is tireless, never gets sick and asks for no holidays or a raise.
The first Dutch Baxter is now a member of Fontys University – photo by John Claessens Connoisseurs of the market see in the friendly looking mechanical employee from Rethink Robotics nothing less than the vanguard of a new robot revolution. Baxter is considered the first robot that for a reasonable price can be deployed side to side with people in a SME production. The simple way in which a task can be ‘taught’ to the robot, the built-in safety features and a price breakthrough will ensure that in the coming years we will encounter robots everywhere.
In the US there are now some 500 sold, in the Netherlands ther is only one Baxter: usually stationed in the robot lab of the Eindhoven University, Fontys, that recently acquired it. However, the Dutch Baxter is also regularly on tour with Ruud van der Burg of the Foundation ‘The Art of Robotics’, which wants to get the Netherlands to become acquainted with the new collaborative robot co-worker.
With a mountain of domino-like stones Van der Burg shows with pleasure how simple Baxter can be programmed. By grabbing one of his arms and leading it to the item, closing the gripper around it and at some distance open it again, Baxter has learnt a task within one minute that he then immediately can repeat it indefinitely.
Little cameras in the wrists of the arm make it possible so that the object doesn’t need to be located at exactly the same place each time. “For such a job with other robots you are often programming it for an entire afternoon”, says van der Burg. “Because Baxter can also work with two arms at the same time and push buttons, it is suitable to place products in boxes or machines”, says Van der Burg, who thinks that with such an amount of convenience for €30,000 these robots certainly will start a break through. Not only in production, but also in the care or retail industries.
The Dutch Baxter is still largely a case study. There is still plenty to improve on this first robot of his generation. It appears during the demonstration a false light can confuse the recognition of objects.
According to Henk Kiela, who as a lecturer at Fontys University, got Baxter to the Netherlands, this is partly due to the choice of cheaper technology, to keep the machine affordable. “But that changes very fast,” he says. “It would not surprise me if the manufacturer would announce tomorrow that it will be equipped with 3D cameras. That would make recognition better in one stroke.” “Especially in the supply industry in and around Eindhoven, this kind of flexible robots would be very useful”, thinks Van der Burg, who does not believe in the doomsday scenario of robots that rob people of their jobs. “This fits well with the small series between 5000 and 10,000 pieces many companies produce here. Nowadays it is not obvious that work is going to China. In that way this type of technology works to our advantage. I think this creates jobs, it doesn’t cost jobs.” Translated from the original Baxter De Telegraaf Article in Dutch .

The elderly are being seen as more and more vulnerable as this pandemic makes its way across the world, so this new robot invented by engineers in Hong Kong could be a new way to keep them safe but also give them the freedom that they deserve. This ‘robotic shopping cart’ will help the elderly with their weekly shop by assisting them to find items and will also allow their family to make sure that they are safe as they do so.
The communication devises on the robot allows the shopper to talk to family and friends as they walk around, this will help them avoid confined, crowded spaces and also reduce their contact with others which will make them less vulnerable to the corona-virus pandemic.
As the person walks around the shops, they tell the cart what they need and then the cart will direct them to it, this can help reduce their contact with shop workers and keep them safe from risks.

18 September 2020 By Antony Lovedale Over the next decade or so, researchers in Edinburgh are working to develop robots that can learn, adapt and take decisions independently of human control. This ambitious and far-reaching work brings together dozens of scientists and engineers from both the University of Edinburgh and Heriot-Watt University together with multiple industrial partners.
The work at Centre for Doctoral Training (CDT) in Robotics and Autonomous Systems (RAD) has funding from EPSRC and industry totalling around £13 million. The CDT addresses the key challenges for understanding and managing the interactions between robots, humans and their environment.
Dr Ramamoorthy’s work is focused on building autonomous robots that are capable of acting intelligently, as equals to human co-workers, in human-robot interactions. The overall goal is to create a structured space where robots can collaborate with each other as well as humans in an effective and efficient way. In order to achieve this there are many aspects to the research work and topics include – vision, manipulation, navigation, language, task and goal recognition, learning and adaptation amongst others.
Dr Ramamoorthy’s group was the first UK educational institution to take delivery of a pair of Baxter robots, he explains how he came to learn about Baxter and why he needed two of them… “I remember my first experience with Baxter was when I heard that Rodney Brooks was setting up a robotics company. We were in the planning stages of our research work and so we were looking at the tools we would be using. My own interests are in the area of robotics and collaborative AI so this seemed like a perfect fit. I liked the fact that Rodney was explicitly looking to make a robot that was easy to work, not the kind of robot where you spend all of your time doing mechanical maintenance or low level programming, but one that you could work with out of the box.
We found that there really isn’t much of an alternative, at this price point, for a bi-manual manipulation robot. We had already been using the Aldebaran Nao robot for some navigation and vision work but that that platform is somewhat constrained in terms of computational resources and we really couldn’t get it to do much bi-manual manipulation. Our other alternative would have been to construct something like Baxter ourselves, and some of my colleagues have made such robots using commercially available arm and hand sub-systems, but we were actively looking for a packaged robot which came with maintenance and a user base. Active Robots came here with Baxter and did a demonstration and presentation for us, and very soon after we bought a pair of them.” “There were a few things that were important to us when evaluating Baxter” continues Ramamoorthy, “ROS was a key requirement of course, we’re not interested in closed proprietary systems as maintenance is a real pain. Robotics is also at a stage where it is very important for us to be able to borrow from and share libraries and modules with others.
We also knew it was important for us to have a robot that could work in a human environment for our interaction work and having two Baxters also allows us to explore robot-robot interactions as well.
We’ve had the Baxters for just over a year now and the experience has been very good. Our first project was undertaken by an MSc student who worked on having Baxter pick up a multi-coloured cube from a human hand, simulating un-fixtured handover of tools and other objects. Although this is a simple problem to start with, it is representative of the kind of work we are doing here. For example, how do we address the context of people holding the cube in a different way, and continually moving and shaking it during the interaction? How does varied lighting affect the ability to track the cube? Once the student had solved these issues we took the robot to the National Museum of Scotland as a demonstration at the Edinburgh International Science festival, where a very diverse selection of members of the public interacted with the Baxter in this way.” There is an excellent YouTube video that provides an overview of the research by Dr Ramamoorthy and contains some footage of Baxter working on the multi-coloured cube problem.
Ramamoorthy adds “We use Baxter at an undergraduate level for final year projects and sometimes even earlier for teaching. Baxter is useful to us as it is an easy to use physical robot and also comes with a simulation framework that you can get into relatively easily. It’s actually a simulation framework that we teach to everybody, to every robotics student. So after they have figured out a certain amount of programming, once they become serious robotics students, we get them involved with ROS and the simulator. So the fact that with Baxter there is a good simulator, a physical robot and easy to access public libraries means it’s relatively low cost for us to get a robotics student up to a sufficient level quickly.” The Human – Robotics interaction laboratory is a modular space where walls, ceilings and floors can be configured for specific experiments. Soon there will be an array of around 120 cameras surrounding the space to provide a dense video stream that can be used to detect gestures, activity and interactive behaviours in long term studies. Active8 Robots took the time to talk to a couple of the groups researchers about their specific research projects.
Nantas Nardelli is from Italy and a 3rd year undergraduate student and research assistant.
“With the cameras around our working area we can use all this information to provide large, possibly longitudinal, visual data libraries for interaction research.” Nardelli continues, “The cameras will feed their data to a large compute server which will perform a bulk of the computation and then feed this information back to the robots within our laboratory.
My project is working with Baxter in the area of task recognition and inference to assess the pattern of specific tasks. Often when humans interact and collaborate on a task there is no speech between them. Generally, humans are really good at interpreting and understanding the task that another is doing. For a robot it has no idea about a task, but they need the ability to recognise tasks and intentions as part of our larger research goals, otherwise an independent autonomous collaboration will not be possible.
The robot could of course receive instructions from a human. But in the first instance they need to be able to recognise a task and its goal independently, so as to not overwhelm the human co-worker with a slew of detailed but essentially trivial questions. Without the ability to recognise task context, robots cannot collaborate with humans effectively. The goal is for them to be largely capable of autonomy, but if a human provides them with instructions, they can learn to get better. So my project is to take some patterns that a human makes, with physical objects like blocks, and see if a robot can complete a pattern that a human has started or learn what the pattern is. This leads to the robot understanding that when a human next builds a similar pattern, and the robot already has a model it can infer from, it can understand the new pattern. This is a basic skill that humans learn as toddlers, and that is perhaps a good place for an intelligent robot to start as well.
We have two Baxters to work with. This enables us to not only look at Human-Robot interactions but also Robot-Robot interactions. If we have an environment where there are multiple robots and humans, the robots need to be able to communicate and work together collaboratively. So we need to be able to look at this as a whole system. In our work we consider each robot as an independent agent, but we also need to study multi agent systems. Each agent has a particular goal or task within the environment, the idea is they can interact and work as one integrated agent, or they can work independently. In our work, we prefer to consider everything separately so each robot as an independent agent. But there is also the possibility that they can assist and help each other, or humans, if the task requires it.
Over the last 20 years the robotics community has started to use techniques developed in natural language processing and understanding as a way to model goals and intention and this is something we are beginning to get curious about. We are looking into fusing all of this work together, to be able to apply it to robotics so that it becomes possible for robots to understand task context.
It turns out that using languages, ‘I do this and then I do this, because I did this’ I’m able to not only map these actions but also the relationships between them, so they can form a goal, and this is really powerful.
Once you have this construct then you can share information far more efficiently and you can transfer knowledge to robots more effectively, rather than program it step by step to do a specific task. So the robot is told the task and goal using these methods and it gets on with the job, but it can ask the human co-worker when needed, being autonomous otherwise. This is exactly the same way that a human approaches a task, they work with what they already know, or have learned, and only seek assistance or more information if required. That is the key, that is what we want to achieve.” Alejandro Bordallo is from Spain and is a final year Ph. D student.
“The aim is to have everything interconnected. So the robots connect to the camera array, and each other robot, everything will be interconnected. This is required in order for us to do the large experiments that we have planned for our research. This will involve multiple robots, of different types, all interacting and co-operating in the same space in real-time. This helps us to move along the path we are taking to establishing a space where there are independent, autonomous robots interacting with humans in a co-operative environment.
We consider this space as a ‘work-cell’. A place where people come and go whilst the robots are going about their business, but the robots should be able to interact with the humans if necessary. So if a person needs help to perform a task, say to move a table, then the robot should understand the task and know what it’s potential role is in this task; maybe it is to observe and provide situational awareness feedback, maybe it is to offer physical assistance, or maybe it has to take charge entirely and follow high level instructions. All of these things we humans take for granted but for a robot, it’s quite hard!
In my research I focus on navigation. So I look at how people navigate their way through a space and record this in video capture. So we start with video recordings. We already have some basic cameras set-up for this. We have data sets of how people navigate their way through space. It’s amazing how people – who have never met – can predict each other’s movements so well. Robots have a problem, they can’t predict very well. So we are using the data sets collated from human interactions to show how a robot should do it. We try to fit models to this data, we have parameters within our models that we can adjust, so that the robot learns how to behave like a human and navigate through a space.
What I am doing at the moment is a form of on-line learning. This is essential in order for a robot to operate autonomously in a space that has changed – say a table has been moved – or it finds itself in a new space. I am working in a dynamic environment and everything has to be done in real-time. So when the robot ‘wakes up’ everything is new and it has to quickly assimilate the topography of the environment it is now in.
One of the other emerging research topics here has to do with ‘language’ and ‘grammar’ of motion and tasks. We vare becoming interested in looking more closely at these areas within the context of human-robot interaction. This does not refer necessarily to speaking, but rather how the task-level interaction works.
This is important when we consider “shaping the intention”. What we mean by that is this: you are solving a task, you have a goal and you are doing it a certain way, but I may prefer for you to do it in a different idiosyncratic way. So, say we are carrying a table and I have a preference for how it is carried, or which way we will go around an object, then I will be defining the interaction by moving or distributing the mass of the table a certain way. So this is something we are looking into with respect to navigation and manipulation within the context of “shaping the intention” — Dr. Ramamoorthy concludes “So, the next frontier for research is to bring in learning, structured representations of tasks, intention and goal recognition into the human – robot interaction. From a research community point of view that is seen as a goal for the upcoming decade. This may well be optimistic, but it is a worthwhile goal to go for, perhaps it takes a bit longer but that is fine as long as we make progress along the way. Many of the components required already exist. Machine learning has really matured during the past decade or two and provides an array of tools, including the emerging possibility of automatically discovering ‘features’ and ‘symbols’ from data. There are emerging techniques for plan and intention recognition. They are already being used, for instance, in specific application areas like language-based and natural user interface work and even in computer security applications. The big open question is how you bring these algorithms, which exist in computational settings where one is already dealing with abstract symbols, and apply them to the physical world where we have until recently been struggling to make sense of much lower level sensorimotor experience.
The most important piece is that there is a planned activity, a part of the activity is consisting of human tasks and the other part is autonomous robot tasks. There are two different kinds of thing here, one of them is how does the human tell the robot, in a natural and iterative way, “this is the task”. You can use a number of modalities here. Of course there is some low level capability already in the system like how to grasp something, but at the next level you want to be able to say “get this object now, don’t do that other thing you are busy with”. That requires some combination of language, gesture, these kind of modalities and there has to be a certain layer of intelligence about how you represent the plan in this kind of a setting and how you understand what is being said.
That’s the kind of problem we are looking into. There are sensing tasks within this, so some of the time you are trying to ask ‘should I go now?’ and that will depend upon what you believe the other person is trying to do. But other times you are trying to ask a more structural question like “are you trying to build a tower or build something else altogether?’ and this is a plan recognition type question, grounded in noisy sensory experience. So for each of these topics, I have a different Ph. D student working on that subcomponent.” This ambitious program will require many people, from diverse perspectives. There will be more than 80 Ph.D. students within the RAS CDT over the coming eight years, and the funding received so far will help support this and the long term research plans of the group. When opening the centre in September 2014, Prof. Sethu Vijayakumar, co-Director of the Centre and Professor of Robotics at the University of Edinburgh, explained that “ The Edinburgh Centre for Robotics aims to help the country realise its industrial potential in this revolution by producing a new generation of highly skilled researchers, trained to take a leading role, technically skilled, industry and market aware, and prepared to create and lead the UK’s innovation pipeline for jobs and growth.” Ramamoorthy concludes “We have laid out a vision that is quite long term and we are fortunate enough to have the funding to pursue our work over that timeframe.

It can erect trays and pass them on to the conveyor in just 3.18 seconds. This solution implements a Sawyer Robot from Rethink Robotics, with our specialised end of arm tooling, to create a collaborative robotic solution that can be used without a cage on a factory line.
This isn’t the only product we’ll be bringing with us either, so follow us on twitter: @active8robots and LinkedIn: Active8 Robots to make sure you hear about our other updates.
Be sure to let us know if you’re attending, and swing by stand A92 to see our Tray Erector.

This year’s Nobel Prize Award Ceremony saw two women receive Nobel Prizes for both the Physics and Chemistry categories.
Frances H. Arnold won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry, for the directed evolution of enzymes. Donna Strickland won the Nobel Prize in Physics for her method of generating high-intensity, ultra-short optical pulses.
This, along with Dr Sue Black OBE becoming the new Professor of Computer Science at Durham University, has made 2018 an exciting year for Women in STEM.
WISE states that “with over 900,000 women in core STEM occupations in 2018, we are on track to reaching WISE’s goal of 1 million women in core STEM in 2020” and we would like to think that this number will continue to grow, as long as we continue to see strong female role models in STEM occupations.
At current in the UK, Physics is the 3rd most popular A-level for boys but only the 19th for girls. On top of this of 14,000 engineering apprentices, in 2017 on 450 were girls. Failing to recruit girls into these areas is not only limiting for girls (missing out on great careers in exciting areas) but also represents a real threat to the UK economy. Gender Diversity is key for UK businesses; it gives employers a better choice of skilled workers, builds a stronger platform for innovation and creativity, and has been proven to create better financial performance.
Organisations that lead the way on gender diversity often also lead on performance and profitability. Those that ignore diversity risk losing out to the competition. Of course, this is not simply due to cause and effect, but the correlation between improved diversity and business results must not be ignored.
Here at Active8 Robots we celebrate and encourage women in STEM, and you can read more about that here . We are excited to see more Women in STEM role models in 2019!

29 January 2018 By Antony Lovedale With robots slowly infiltrating our daily lives, surely there should be more of them in schools helping children get used to working alongside automation and gaining experience in Technology and Science subjects which are coming to dominate the workplace.
So, why should schools start using robots in their lessons?
Robotics is a subject that can be taught at any level or ability, especially with the range of Educational Robots on the market. Lego® Education products for instance span all key stages. There are build and code robot kits suitable for children as young as four and with many products offering lesson plans and example instructions, they can be altered to suit any class level.
You can use them to teach other skills. Primarily, the whole idea of introducing robots to schools is to teach about robots, but building and coding robot kits put children in a position where they are manually manipulating sensors and motors, which helps improve motor skills and coordination.
In addition, you can also use robotics to introduce real world learning into the classroom, children can learn about climate change, architecture and engineering, as well as other subjects, like biology by building and designing humanoid or animal like robots, bridges and other structures.
Still on the subject of skills, getting pupils to build robots introduces hands on skills, where they can work as a team practicing their communication, collaboration and critical thinking skills.
Importantly, bringing robots into the classroom prepares children for a 21 st century workforce. The workplace is changing rapidly and with more and more industries turning to automation, from factories to supermarkets, its essential that pupils have Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics subjects. It has been reported that 50% of today’s children will have jobs that don’t exist yet, so they need to be prepared!
Introducing robotic kits provides a base for teaching computer programming, by beginning with a physical robot and learning by demonstration, students will find the theory aspect easier to grasp.
Having lessons with robotics promotes innovation and gives pupils entrepreneurial skills as building and coding require creative thinking. By giving students the ability to explore robotics and engineering, they can create their own programs and allowing them to see the coding play out in real time.
Finally, playing with robots is fun and you always learn and retain information better when its fun. So… We have a mission to bring STEM to the forefront of educational facilities and as such, have a wide range of products to help with the implementation of robotics and engineering in lessons. Not only do we have standard classroom sets from Lego® Education and other buildable robot kits, we also stock Arduino, Phidgets and other products from motors, boards and components. For those of you looking for more high end robotics, there are also options for AR10 Robot Hands and a range of collaborative robots perfect for universities or research facilities. Get in touch with our team at either [email protected] for components and kits or [email protected] for collaborative robots.

21 January 2020 By Antony Lovedale Recent reports of a living robot might be a bit premature, but it’s definitely a step in that direction.
The team from the University of Vermont have produced a living organism from Xenopus genus frog stem cells. The organism uses skin and cardiac cells to make an organism that can move and potentially carry materials from one place to another.
The real cleaver aspect to the research is the AI design process behind the organism, which is first designed in a virtual petri dish, with the optimum organism being grown in virtual space on a super computer, before being built to that design manually, cell by cell. This process will be automated in later trials.
The organism is being described by the researchers as a Xenobot but the organism isn’t strictly speaking, a living organism by most definitions, it has no reproductive cells. Likewise, it isn’t in any way programmable or reactive in its environment. Next stage trials are planned to include sensory cells such as light or chemo receptors and eventually possibly neuro cells for processing and even decision making. There will be a moral and regulatory course to navigate here.
As this research progresses it will increasingly push the boundaries of what is living and as possible applications come to light, what robots are. At this stage however, this living, non-life organism, capable of only stumbling forwards, would perhaps, be more accurate to described as a Xenozombie. We watch with interest to see how this technology progresses, could it be the embryonic beginnings of a new world or organo-robotics.

22 October 2018 By Antony Lovedale There is a big debate at the moment about what defines a robot. How automated and programmable must something be to fit within the “robot” category? Is a washing machine a robot? What about an automatic door? Or what about this Frozen Yoghurt machine?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WupotcLG6eY When you hear the word “robot”, the first thing that probably comes to mind is an image of something off iRobot or another popular feature film; something humanoid with its own intelligence. Although these types of robots do exist, there are also autonomous drones, Vacuum cleaning robots and self-driving cars. A robot can be a lot of things these days, and the main point of them is to do things that humans can’t, so often being shaped like a human is the exact opposite of what is needed.
With so many different types of robot, how do you define exactly what one is? Engineers agree that it’s a physical thing, but still if you ask three roboticists to define a robot you’ll get three different answers. This isn’t just semantics either; thinking about what a robot really is has implications for how humanity deals with the unfolding future of the technology.
Think about a car, one driven by a human driver and the other is autonomous, starting up, navigating obstacles, and braking all on its own. Are these both robots? Nope. Some say that robots must be able to make decisions. It is a thinking agent that senses and interacts with its world. This means that intelligence is a core component of what makes a robot a robot and not a wind-up toy.
But just how intelligent does a machine have to be to qualify as a robot?
Kate Darling , a roboticist at the MIT Media Lab, says “My definition of a robot, given that there is no very good universal definition, would probably be a physical machine that’s usually programmable by a computer that can execute tasks autonomously or automatically by itself,” whereas Hanumant Singh , a roboticist at North-eastern University, says a robot is “a system that exhibits ‘complex’ behaviour and includes sensing and actuation.” So, Mr Singh’s definition doesn’t mention anything about autonomy.
If a machine is autonomous, its more than likely that it is a robot but there are different degrees of autonomous intelligence. It’s simple enough to program a machine to respond to a single input with a single output, but as algorithms improve, robots will respond to their environments in ways that humans didn’t necessarily teach them too. And this kind of intelligence is the type that will get robots driving us around, helping the elderly, and keeping us company.
New think robots are more aware and sensitive to its users needs. This responsive type of robot will react differently once corrected by the user; they not only respond to users but anticipate them. This nuance is important, because robot is a powerful word. It is something that generates attention, fascination, and fear all at once.
For that matter, “robot” is certainly a simpler title than “physically embodied artificially intelligent agent”, but a robot is a machine that senses and acts on its world.
Active8 Robots works with multiple robotics manufacturers as we recognise that no two robots are the same.

It is ABB’s most collaborative robot to date, which can be easily integrated into any production environment.
After the success of ABB’s dual-arm YuMi, last year (2018) ABB developed a single-arm YuMi to expand its collaborative portfolio. Prior to its release last year Sami Atiya, President of ABB’s Robotics and Motion division, said “based on YuMi’s enormous success, we fully expect our new single-arm robot to be equally well-received, especially since it was developed at the request of customers.” Versatile installation for convenient deployment Single-arm YuMi is compact and lightweight (9.5kg) and supports mounting in any direction for rapid and flexible installation to fit into existing production lines. The ultra-light magnesium arm rotates on even axes to mimic human-like movements with greater agility than 6-axis robots. The robot was specifically designed to meet the flexible production needs required by small parts assembly processes including consumer electronics, consumer goods, and small and medium enterprises.
Easy-to-use lead-through programming Single-arm YuMi also features the same intuitive, easy-to-use lead-through programming as dual-arm YuMi, meaning workers can teach the robot motions and positions easily and quickly, greatly simplifying robot programming. Combining this simplicity with the robot’s deployment flexibility will help manufacturers in many industries to offset shortages of skilled workers and help reduce entry barriers for new potential robot users, particularly in small and medium enterprises.
Extremely versatile, the YuMi family of robots can be combined in numerous configurations. For example, a single-arm YuMi can be used to feed parts to dual-arm YuMi to increase flexibility or added as an extra arm for more complex assembly tasks requiring more than 2 robot arms.
SafeMove2 Option To fulfil the enhanced safety requirements of specific usage scenarios, ABB’s SafeMove2 will be available as an option for the single-arm YuMi, giving it the full range of safety certified functions that other ABB robots have.
Key Features: 500g rated payload Small footprint, 7-axis dexterity Very lightweight manipulator, 9.5kg Mounting in any position Integrated gripper with vision and vacuum Best-in-class safety design High speed and accuracy PL d Cat 3 Protective stop and emergency stop Customer benefits Short cycle times Fenceless operations Easy programming with lead-through Lower investment Easier to integrate What is so special about single-arm YuMi?
The single-arm YuMi’s external controller enables the robot arm to have a much smaller footprint to fit into confined spaces The low weight and possibility to mount the single-arm YuMi at any angle makes it even more flexible and agile How does the single-arm YuMi differ from the dual-arm robot?
The single-arm YuMi can be mounted at any angle for maximum flexibility Its small footprint and seven axis agility mean it can operate in extremely confined spaces The single-arm YuMi uses an external controller that adds flexibility for mounting in constrained places or from the ceiling When do customers use dual-arm YuMi and when do they use single-arm YuMi?
Each assembly application is different- some are more suited to the dual-arm, 14 axis YuMi, while others are more suited to the single-arm YuMi. Still, others might be more suited to a combination of both robots.
Think the YuMi single-arm robot might help to increase productivity in your production line?

Getting it wrong can render a robot useless. Getting it right on the other hand, can add enormous value to the entire automation process.
.For example, a single multifunctional tool can greatly reduce downtime on a manufacturing line compared to switching between several individual tools. Similarly, an end effector manufactured using a lighter weight material alternative can cut operational energy use and associated costs.
There are many factors to consider when scoping out what is needed for different applications, which can make EOAT selection a minefield. For instance, if a collaborative robotic arm is fitted with an end effector comprising a blade or syringe, even with the Power and Force Limiting (PFL) feature, human safety can be compromised.
We have developed our own high-performance off-the-shelf robot grippers to satisfy different requirements. We also offer a wide range of EOAT solutions from some of the world’s leading manufacturers. This includes vacuum, pneumatic, hydraulic, electronic and electromagnetic grippers.
For specialist applications, we are renowned for our bespoke end effector solutions from food grade rotational tools for handling filled sandwiches to shrouded pneumatic grippers for odd shaped trigger spray bottles Whatever the considerations, we will walk you through each step to help you choose the right tool for your robot.

Cleaning. And out of the thousands of tasks that come under the cleaning umbrella, it’s window cleaning that can be the most awkward, and even dangerous. So, if robots were made for anything, surely it was to make our life easier and safer.
Its crazy to think that in this day and age people still strap themselves into metal scaffolds and put their lives in the hands of a system of ropes and harnesses. If window cleaning 30-story high buildings isn’t the perfect job for a robot then what is? Skyline Robotics have created the solution, Ozmo. A robot for real estate maintenance at heights utilising computer vision and machine learning to adapt to the complex geometry of skyscrapers, to create the most effective cleaning pattern.
Although some will say that this is another way that robots are taking human’s jobs, Skyline Robots says that they came up with this idea because they believe that “humans are more than robots”. It’s a dangerous job with unnecessary risk, so why not get a robot to do it instead. Now, instead of needing 3 cleaners risking their lives, the robot just needs one controller on the ground to clean a building. Ozmo has been designed to clean any building without changing or adding any infrastructure. On top of this Ozmo only uses a distilled water and so doesn’t cost the building owners any extra in purchasing equipment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jz9VqDpZRHQ To us at Active8 Robots, the whole point of having this technology available is that we can decrease the risk to humans in the workplace, and this is a perfect example of that. Why risk a human life when a robot can do the job for you? Skyline Robotics says they “aim to automate all tasks that are dangerous, dirty, and dull”. The company also state that once the company starts generating revenue, it will put in place a Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) program to pay for the first two years of basic engineering training on the Ozmo system of any window washer they are displacing.
If you have any dangerous tasks in your manufacturing line, or jobs that are mundane and boring, why not contact us to see if they could be automated instead?

The ability to connect manufacturing equipment to a Web-based network and derive substantial value from these connections is more practical and compelling than ever. Although we are in the early stages of this development, many of the foundations are in place.
It’s imperative that manufacturers take head when it comes to recognising what this combination of industrial and technological improvements could do for them. Through implementing cobots which collect big data, manufacturers will open themselves up to much better decision making opportunities. Through collecting data and understanding the results more fully, strategic objectives and benchmark performance can be more easily achieved. Decisions will begin to be based on knowledge and wisdom instead of theory and guesswork.
Our simple “Duck Shy”, works through allowing attendees to join an online queue in order to take turns at playing the game. It very simple demonstrates how, through an online platform, a cobot can be controlled using the internet. It’s a tiny little taster of the future of Industry 4.0 and allows players to engage with a cobot in a way that is meaningful to them, outside of the manufacturing business.

The Robot Positioning System allows users to quickly re-deploy Baxter using the new Landmarks™ feature meaning that downtime and retraining of the robot is kept to an absolute minimum. This groundbreaking technology allows the Baxter collaborative robot to adapt to ever changing requirements in its real-world environment, such as re-deployment across tasks, movement of fixtures or simply a table being bumped out of its original position.
Intera 3.1 now makes Baxter even easier to train and manage within your existing factory dynamics.
By using environmental markers, called Landmarks™, alongside the existing embedded vision system on Baxter, the robot can adjust more readily to an ever changing work environment. By using Landmarks™ Baxter is now able to see where it is, and understand what task is being expected based on the Robot Positioning System technology. This makes is much easier for manufacturers to deploy Baxter across a range of applications without the need for complex re-programming like with a traditional industrial robot.
“Manufacturing robots have always been caged, not only to protect the workers around them from harm, but also to protect their precisely configured environments from being disrupted by those same workers,” said Scott Eckert, CEO at Rethink Robotics . “With Baxter, we brought the manufacturing robot out of its cage by making it safe enough to work next to people; and now, we’ve made it safe for the robot to work effectively in real-world conditions as well, by allowing it to adapt to everyday variations that people naturally produce.” By working closely with adopters of the Baxter Manufacturing Robot, Rethink Robotics created the Robot Positioning System as part of the Intera 3.1 software release to adapt to users’ needs. By listening to the end user, and working with them to create a practical solution, the Baxter robot platform will continue to evolve into the future, maximising return on investments and creating increasingly efficient workforces, further reducing the need for offshoring.
“We need our people and our automation to effectively work in a semi-structured, and sometimes variable, manufacturing environment. Rethink’s Baxter robot, particularly with the new Robot Positioning System, provides a solution that can finally adjust to the changing conditions of our work cells,” said Chris Hager, Information Technology Manager at the Michigan-headquartered Praxis Packaging Solutions. “No other robot built for manufacturers can come close to providing the flexibility and adaptability of Baxter.” Users can now define Baxter’s environment with up to 20 Landmarks, saving time, manpower and resources when it comes to switching the applications Baxter is working on. The Robot Positioning System enables Baxter to adapt quickly to workstation changes of up to +/-50mm horizontally and within +/-10 degrees of rotation, by marking the new Landmark locations and accounting for any accidental movement or shifts in the workspace. The result is an automation solution that can readily adapt to common variations in its environment – saving considerable time and helping to keep production lines up and running.
Intera 3.1 updates will be provided by Active8 Robots , Rethink Robotics’ official partner in the UK and Europe for the Baxter Robot, for more information Contact Us .

03 January 2018 By Antony Lovedale The UK is suffering from a skills shortage, particularly in manufacturing, something that is likely to get worse over the coming years but something that can be solved by joining the revolution of Industry 4.0.
Industry 4.0 will help businesses grow using automation and artificial intelligence to fill this gap left by the lack of low skilled workers (as seen in the Deloitte study – https://goo.gl/TwRer6 ) and the introduction of collaborative robots, which can work safely alongside humans. Using cobots will ensure that the dull, dirty and dangerous work can still continue and that members of staff can be upskilled and redeployed to increase productivity. Research has suggested that capitalising on Industry 4.0 can help improve competition among manufacturers, but on the world stage, the UK is one of the last countries to jump on board.
Surveys have shown that many firms are saying that they have a lack of funds, skills and support to move forward with automation, which is where companies like Active8 can help with the integration of robots, the development of tooling and training.
It has been reported that employee engagement is critical for companies wanting to embrace the future and deploying cobots (as this KPMG report shows https://goo.gl/Cv5RDt), which are quick and easy to repurpose and safe to work alongside people, is a cost-effective way for businesses to move into the future of manufacturing. What other measures do you think are stopping manufacturers from moving into Industry 4.0?

Brent Balinski spoke to the Australian-born and Boston-based founder, CTO and chairman of Rethink Robotics.
An answer to labour shortages Rodney Brooks’s robotic innovations have found their way into places as varied as the battlefields in Iraq and Afghanistan, the radioactive ruins of Fukushima, the surface of Mars, and even onto our livingroom floors.
The Adelaide-born MIT Professor Emeritus is right now concerned with the world’s factories, though. He believes the need for help – in the form of factory robots – has never been greater.
“Manufacturing across the world is suffering from a lack of labour,” he said.
Brooks said he started to see the supply of work in China dry up in about 2005. He had been visiting regularly since 1997 in his previous board/founder role at iRobot and saw that outsourcing was looking less and less sustainable .
“You talk to a Chinese manufacturer and they’ll say their biggest problem is recruitment and retention for their labour,” he said of the situation today.
The country is currently scrambling to develop and buy enough robots to deal with its labour availability and price challenges. One high-profile example of the rush for robots is the iPhone contractor Foxconn .
Globally speaking, Brooks believes it’s a “ knee in the curve ” moment for collaborative robots, such as those made by the company he co-founded and is chairman and CTO of, Rethink Robotics.
“I think people are starting to see that it makes sense to put robots in to do the really dull, repetitive jobs that the robots can do,” he told Manufacturers’ Monthly , during a visit to Australia this week.
“And [also] have people who are much smarter than any of the robots – and much more dexterous – to do the more dexterous tasks. And that’s a way to increase productivity in a world where they just can’t get enough labour.” The apparent explosion in demand for non-human help that is easy to program, flexible, relatively cheap and safe to work around can be seen in the race by established robotics companies to add “co-bots” to their offerings. A fresh example is the introduction of ABB’s YuMi at last week’s Hannover Messe expo .

The Strongest Cobot on the Market The ability to lift up to 35kg, combined with reach of 1813mm, means the CR35 is ideally suited to a whole range of manual processes that other cobots are not capable of completing. It is also ideal for those heavy lifting tasks that can cause repetitive strain and other work-related injuries.
Can Work Alongside You If you want to combine the strength, precision and repeatability of a robot with human know-how and manual dexterity, collaborative robots make the best choice – by working hand in hand, humans and robots can add real value to your processes.
The CR35iA stops gently after a collision with a fixed object or person and retracts. A safety system ensures that the robot stops at a maximum of 150N. This force threshold can even be reduced if required. The push back function also means that operators can simply push back the robot’s two major axis to free themselves should the robot pose a risk.
No Need for Fences The CR35iA is equipped with FANUC collision stop protection. For maximum reliability, this uses proven sensor technology. It also has a function to restart itself easily and quickly after a stop. In addition to contact stop, the CR35 comes with push back and anti-trap features for additional protection.
To prevent the risk of pinching, the larger CR-35iA model comes wrapped in a passive soft cover. The cover also reduces contact pressure and, in the event of an impact, provides cushioning.
The cobot meets ISO 10218 and ISO 13849 Cat. 3 Pld. It can also achieve ISO/TS 15066. To further increase productivity, additional third-party safety devices can be fitted.
Can recognise Objects Depending on what you want to do, the CR35iA can be equipped with a variety of sensors. Opening up a wealth of possibilities, the 3D Area Sensors even enable the robot to pick randomly distributed parts from a bin. Force Sensors detect force and torque applied to the end effector allowing the robot to carry out collaborative assembly, fitting and weighing operations for example. Using Vision Sensors, the CR35 is capable of locating workpieces, reading bar codes and sorting by colour.
Easy to Guide For easy programming and handling, FANUC Hand Guidance allows you to teach your collaborative robot by leading it through paths and/or use it to lift heavy objects manually. This is made possible by an emergency stop button and a three-position enabling switch that meets ISO 10218 and ISO/TS 15066.

What is Space Enabled Technology?
Space data encompasses all of the technologies that use satellite data. This includes satellite navigation, communication and Earth Observation.
Let’s take a closer look; Earth Observation (EO) Imagery obtained from Earth Observation satellites can provide data on everything from weather patterns to urban traffic. For example, satellites detecting unusual weather patterns can help to provide predictions and a detailed picture of large-scale environmental issues for conservation planning.
Satellite Communications (Satcom) In addition to imagery, satellites can help communicate large amounts of data between remote locations. This includes Internet of Things (IoT) technologies which connect machines through networks of sensors.
This type of technology can be used to monitor equipment in manufacturing and improve maintenance operations.
Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) The benefit of GNNS is that it can provide precise location tracking of goods and people. This is particularly useful for the logistics industry and for route optimization used in AI applications.
Virtual and Augmented Reality Although not technically a space-enabled technology, satcom-supported VR and AR can complement AI applications. For example, allowing humans to perform tasks remotely through VR/AR goggles.

Here, we explore the sectors benefiting from these new technologies and discuss how the implementation of space enabled technologies could transform AI .
What is Artificial Intelligence Firstly, artificial intelligence (AI) refers to computers or computer-controlled robots which are built to perform tasks previously performed solely by humans.
AI is currently being used in wide-ranging sectors across the UK; Retail AI has the potential to collect and analyse large amounts of data to help understand customer behaviour and predict future sales.
Manufacturing, Transport and Logistics Manufacturing centres are adopting AI technologies to improve efficiency and safety by automating dangerous tasks.
Electric Utilities Analysis of satellite data can help predict weather patterns, helping to match renewable energy supply with demand. The forecast of congestion, network losses, and the possible need for reserve power can all be improved by AI.
What is Space Enabled Technology?
Space data encompasses all of the technologies that use satellite data. This includes satellite navigation, communication and Earth Observation.
Let’s take a closer look; Earth Observation (EO) Imagery obtained from Earth Observation satellites can provide data on everything from weather patterns to urban traffic. For example, satellites detecting unusual weather patterns can help to provide predictions and a detailed picture of large-scale environmental issues for conservation planning.
Satellite Communications (Satcom) In addition to imagery, satellites can help communicate large amounts of data between remote locations. This includes Internet of Things (IoT) technologies which connect machines through networks of sensors.
This type of technology can be used to monitor equipment in manufacturing and improve maintenance operations.
Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) The benefit of GNNS is that it can provide precise location tracking of goods and people. This is particularly useful for the logistics industry and for route optimization used in AI applications.
Virtual and Augmented Reality Although not technically a space-enabled technology, satcom-supported VR and AR can complement AI applications. For example, allowing humans to perform tasks remotely through VR/AR goggles.

What is Artificial Intelligence Firstly, artificial intelligence (AI) refers to computers or computer-controlled robots which are built to perform tasks previously performed solely by humans.
AI is currently being used in wide-ranging sectors across the UK; Retail AI has the potential to collect and analyse large amounts of data to help understand customer behaviour and predict future sales.
Manufacturing, Transport and Logistics Manufacturing centres are adopting AI technologies to improve efficiency and safety by automating dangerous tasks.
Electric Utilities Analysis of satellite data can help predict weather patterns, helping to match renewable energy supply with demand. The forecast of congestion, network losses, and the possible need for reserve power can all be improved by AI.
What is Space Enabled Technology?
Space data encompasses all of the technologies that use satellite data. This includes satellite navigation, communication and Earth Observation.
Let’s take a closer look; Earth Observation (EO) Imagery obtained from Earth Observation satellites can provide data on everything from weather patterns to urban traffic. For example, satellites detecting unusual weather patterns can help to provide predictions and a detailed picture of large-scale environmental issues for conservation planning.
Satellite Communications (Satcom) In addition to imagery, satellites can help communicate large amounts of data between remote locations. This includes Internet of Things (IoT) technologies which connect machines through networks of sensors.
This type of technology can be used to monitor equipment in manufacturing and improve maintenance operations.
Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) The benefit of GNNS is that it can provide precise location tracking of goods and people. This is particularly useful for the logistics industry and for route optimization used in AI applications.
Virtual and Augmented Reality Although not technically a space-enabled technology, satcom-supported VR and AR can complement AI applications. For example, allowing humans to perform tasks remotely through VR/AR goggles.

From manufacturing to healthcare, intelligent machines are streamlining processes, improving efficiency and lowering costs for businesses in the long term.
But what has space technology got to do with AI? And how are these new technologies transforming wide-ranging sectors for the better?
Here, we explore the sectors benefiting from these new technologies and discuss how the implementation of space enabled technologies could transform AI .
What is Artificial Intelligence Firstly, artificial intelligence (AI) refers to computers or computer-controlled robots which are built to perform tasks previously performed solely by humans.
AI is currently being used in wide-ranging sectors across the UK; Retail AI has the potential to collect and analyse large amounts of data to help understand customer behaviour and predict future sales.
Manufacturing, Transport and Logistics Manufacturing centres are adopting AI technologies to improve efficiency and safety by automating dangerous tasks.
Electric Utilities Analysis of satellite data can help predict weather patterns, helping to match renewable energy supply with demand. The forecast of congestion, network losses, and the possible need for reserve power can all be improved by AI.
What is Space Enabled Technology?
Space data encompasses all of the technologies that use satellite data. This includes satellite navigation, communication and Earth Observation.
Let’s take a closer look; Earth Observation (EO) Imagery obtained from Earth Observation satellites can provide data on everything from weather patterns to urban traffic. For example, satellites detecting unusual weather patterns can help to provide predictions and a detailed picture of large-scale environmental issues for conservation planning.
Satellite Communications (Satcom) In addition to imagery, satellites can help communicate large amounts of data between remote locations. This includes Internet of Things (IoT) technologies which connect machines through networks of sensors.
This type of technology can be used to monitor equipment in manufacturing and improve maintenance operations.
Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) The benefit of GNNS is that it can provide precise location tracking of goods and people. This is particularly useful for the logistics industry and for route optimization used in AI applications.

This has inspired the team at Active8 Robots to introduce a range of EOAT to suit any application’s needs.
Active8 Robots has designed and created high performance robotic end effectors and gripper systems for turn-key automated solutions. Our EOATs have all been designed with robustness and functionality in mind, and although our standard tooling is suitable for a wide range of applications, we can alter and modify them to fit a client’s specific needs. If an application demands a more complex solution then we can also help by developing and creating a completely new EOAT on site.
This need for bespoke tooling is greater than ever before, as more and more applications are non-standard, due to the individuality of each manufacturing process. Luckily, Active8 Robots has the capacity in-house to design and create our own bespoke End of Arm Tooling, which means we can make the exact tooling needed for any specific application, no matter how complex. With a range of 3D printers at our disposal, Active8 Robots can easily create prototype EOAT in order for it to be promptly tested in a proof of concept. Once created the grippers can either be added onto your solution or sold as an individual unit.
Our End of Arm Tooling can be supplied as a single unit, without the purchase of a whole application. This means if you already own a robot arm, or have invested in an application from another company, you are still able to buy our end effectors, and be safe in the knowledge that they were designed and developed by one of the most experienced teams around.
On top of this all of Active8 Robots’ End Effectors are “Easy Swap” which, combined with the fact that they are suitable for a broad range of industrial and collaborative robots, means that they can undertake a range of tasks and speed up productivity in your workplace. We have the capability to make tools for various robots, and have already worked with many companies to create exactly what they need to increase their productivity.
If you think bespoke EOAT is what your automated solution needs then contact Active8 Robots here to discuss what we could do for you.

24 September 2018 By Antony Lovedale Two tiny rovers have landed on an asteroid. The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (Jaxa), have landed two robots on the pristine asteroid Ryugu. This asteroid has been unchanged since the formation of the Galaxy!
Jaxa’s spacecraft, Hayabusa 2, arrived to orbit the asteroid a few days ago to find the perfect landing spot for the two robots. Having landed safely they’ve already phoned home to say they’ve arrived, and have sent some photos too!
Although engineers with the agency deployed the robots early Friday, JAXA waited until Saturday to confirm the success of the operation.
Part of their mission will be to collect samples from just below the surface. Could it be that the seeds of life on earth were sown by an asteroid like Ryugu? We’ll find out when they come home with their souvenirs. Hayabusa 2 was launched in December 2014 and is planned to return with the samples to Earth by then end of 2020.
The agency still has two more deployments yet to accomplish before it can rest easy: Hayabusa2 is scheduled to deploy a larger rover called MASCOT in October and another tiny hopper next year. And of course, the main spacecraft has a host of other tasks to accomplish during its stay at Ryugu.

12 January 2018 By Antony Lovedale After spotting a picture of Rethink Robotics’ Sawyer robot wearing a hairnet as it got stuck into production at a factory in France, we started thinking about industries that could automate where hygiene is important.
Image from Rethink Robotics Everyone is aware of the strict rules surrounding the processing of food in factories. Even if you don’t work in the food industry, you know the rules about gloves and jewellery and hand sanitiser, all things easily implemented by humans, but is it something we can teach robots?
Robots have been used in packaging for years indeed, many food processing plants use them to pack away the finished product. So, how can a robot replicate the hygiene solutions needed to help automate the rest of the workflow?
We have the ability to design and develop end effectors for a variety of collaborative robots, the only real limit is the client’s imagination. Our team of designers can easily create these out of food grade materials to enable automation of the food industry. These end of arm tools are simple to swap out and clean to maintain a hygienic environment, are there any other industries where you might be concerned about a robot giving it a go?

The training took them over the basics of programming the robot as well as learning about the new force-torque sensor, allowing the engineers to work on new applications where a controlled force must be applied by the tool. At the end of the course they were given the opportunity to see the robot factory. One of our engineers, Callum, said “it was fascinating to see the cobots working alongside skilled workers, being used to make more of the same cobots”.
At Active8 Robots we understand that the technology we use is constantly developing and changing. We strive to ensure that our engineers are not only up to date with the most recent cobots available on the market, but that they are able to use and integrate them with ease. These training days are essential to ensure that our engineers are constantly developing, and that we can offer the best possible solutions with the most up to date technology to our customers.

When a human does these kinds of tasks, we wiggle it about, from side to side, until it goes in. Up until now, this has been something that a robot would find extremely hard to execute.
But now you can do this with your robot too, using force torque sensing.
Find out how you can add force torque sensing to your robot here.
In this example, the robot uses vision to pick up a USB lid, but uses force torque sensing to discover which way round the cap is, then continues to fit the USB cap the correctly.
The force torque sensor can be added to most platforms, but is native to the Universal Robot. In this example you can see the Force Co-Pilot software from Robotiq.
You can use this software to make better use of the force torque sensing abilities of your Universal Robot e-Series.
For the CB series robots, the software comes with an end of arm sensor. The sensor is built to an exceptionally high standard but weighs just 300 grams.
Our verdict?
The Robotiq force torque sensing software is superb for time saving, and is a way to expand the capabilities of Universal Robots all designed to help you to start production faster.  If you use your robot for a mix of applications, you should have this capability.
For other platforms, you will need the ability to use the information from the sensor in your programming, but there are few simpler or more accurate ways to tool your robot and give it a sense of touch.
Find out more here about Force Torque Sensing for your robot.
If you have a more dexterous task that you didn’t think a robot was capable of completing, then think again. Force torque sensors could be the way forward.

With super deduction tax on main rate new plant and machinery kicking off tomorrow, now is the time to stop thinking and start doing.
Super deduction will allow you to cut your tax bill by: up to 25p for every £1 invested, providing a 130% allowance on qualifying assets that would normally qualify for a mere 18% write down.
a first-year allowance of 50% on qualifying special rate assets that would ordinarily qualify for a 6% relief .
Taking advantage of this generous capital allowance measure will mean that you will be able to write off the costs of tangible capital assets in your robotic automation project against your taxable income.
In addition, if you are spending money on developing new, or improving existing processes, products or services, you may well be eligible for Research and Development (R&D) tax relief.
Money spent on innovation may qualify for a R&D tax credit claim, which can be received either through a cash payment or a reduction in Corporation Tax but for non-exempt SME’s, this will be capped at £20k plus 300% total PAYE and National Insurance Contributions (NIC) liability.
For larger companies undertaking R&D projects and SMEs subcontracted by a larger company to do R&D work (or received a grant or subsidy for their project), R&D Expenditure Credit (RDEC) may be claimed. The taxable credit is calculated at 13% of your company’s qualifying R&D expenditure.
Typical R&D project costs that can be claimed include: staff pay and employer Class 1 NIC and pension fund contributions .
consumable materials and utilities e.g., energy and water; and software.
Simon Neath, Financial Director at Active8 Robots, recommends: Do not forget that R&D also includes time spent assessing the technical feasibility of a project, researching potential solutions, planning, Q&A testing, engineering work amongst other factors.
On the whole , the UK manufacturing sector has been pitifully slow to adopt new technologies . We shamefully lag so far behind that we did not even make it to the list of 21 most automated countries according to the latest World Robotics statistics, issued by the International Federation of Robotics (#IFR).
We can no longer afford to be losers in the race to become a technology superpower .
Industry needs to improve productivity and investing in automation can help achieve this.
So, if you have been thinking about automating outdated manual production processes, now presents the ideal opportunity to bring your planned automation investments forward.
Let us not stagnate .
Let us innovate and automate.
Remember, the super deduction incentive is only a temporary measure ending 31 March 2023. Two years will soon fly by.
The journey is ON.
Let’s GO!

18 November 2019 By Antony Lovedale Scientists from The University Of Sussex and the Tokyo University of Science build a sonic tractor beam, and use it for 3D display.
R2D2 3D Graphic display. video via GIPHY In an Article in Nature this week, scientists have demonstrated new technology that makes 3D display a reality.  Not like the 3D we see in cinemas, designed to trick the viewers eye, but actual 3 dimensional display that can simultaneously deliver visual, auditory and tactile content.
Read the research article in Nature here .
It works by elevating a particle or bead and controlling its position with sound waves.  Researchers can move the particle at speeds of up to 8.75 metres per second and 3.75 metres per second in the vertical and horizontal directions, respectively. By doing this, then illuminating the bead with red, green and blue LEDs at high frequencies, the display can be built in real space.
While this technology offers the possibility of a new way to display and interact with our robots like the Sci-Fi droid from the 70s classic, this looks set to be the beginning of one of those innovations which branches in to many areas and continues to evolve, impacting industry and every day life alike.
Could the next collaborative manipulators be less like robot arms and more like a 70s ghetto blaster?

After the great reception in the USA, helping companies like John Deere, Genco , Schneider Electric and Flambeau , the Baxter Manufacturing Robot is now available in the UK and Europe with ISO 10218-1 & ISO 10218-2 certification for production prototyping use.
The Baxter Manufacturing Robot benefits from an upgrade to the powerful Intera 3 software which doubles Baxter’s speed and accuracy to within 0.5 mm and expands a broader range of applications including: Tending to machines such as CNC lathes, ultrasonic welders and press brakes Packing and unpacking of parts and components Line loading and unloading Kitting The University of Sheffield have recently announced that they will be implementing the Baxter Robot into their Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre (AMRC) as part of their commitment to researching the next generation of robotic technologies with their manufacturing partners like Boeing and Rolls Royce.
“We needed a more flexible automation solution that can quickly and easily be modified to meet the fluctuating demands of our customers,” said Scott Borthwick, production supervisor at California-based Kaiser-Permanente Optical Lab. “The software makes it possible for our team to train Baxter on new tasks as they arise, with no loss of productivity.” Normal Industrial Robots can take between 9 – 18 months from initial enquiry to full integration, whereas Rodney Brooks, Founder of Rethink Robotics highlights, “Our goal is it will take two hours from delivery of the robot to when it’s doing productive work. In our trials it’s been less than an hour. A person who has never seen a robot before can learn to train it in 5 to 10 minutes.” Companies have reported that typical Return On Investment (ROI) can be in as little as 12 months which, when added to the already generous savings when compared to an industrial robot, makes for an even smarter investment for the future.
Active8 Robots can undertake a feasibility study for any industry and provide a free demonstration to show how Baxter can work for your business.
Baxter is available now, price from £19,000/ €22,000 and is ISO 10218-1 & ISO 10218-2 for prototype industrial use.

Before you fully commit to spending on a full-blown project, you will want to be confident that what we are proposing is the best option, that it will work and that it will achieve your automation goals and objectives. A PoC gives the opportunity to understand the proposal, visualise it in situ, voice any concerns, provide feedback and fine tune before finalising your decision and moving on with the real thing.
We will design and build physical test rigs, or create a 2D and 3D statistical digital simulation to identify technical issues that might interfere with the success of a project and then iron them out to eradicate any chance of failure. From defining the scope to evaluating feedback from all stakeholders, we adopt best practice principles in our process. This includes fluid open flow communication and involving you at every step of the way.
Our process essentially comprises the following steps: Whether it is additive manufacturing for physical proofs or digital twins for virtual proofs, we have all of the tools under one roof and know how best to use them to develop precise proofs of concepts. We are also able to draw on the knowledge and resources of our keys partners, including specialist research and technology organisations such as MTC to optimise results.

A University in New York has recently taken a huge step on this road, by giving a robot a primitive sense of self awareness.
Humans are able to imagine themselves doing a task, they are able to remember how they have done it in the past and can recall occasions when it went wrong.  By giving the robot an internal image of itself, it can learn in the same way, offering new levels of resilience and adaptability.
“If we want robots to become independent, to adapt quickly to scenarios unforeseen by their creators, then it’s essential that they learn to simulate themselves.” s ays Hod Lipson, Columbia University’s Professor of Mechanical Engineering. The robot is able to teach itself to handle objects without vision, adapting to changing circumstances. In one experiment the team simulated an injury, by changing a robot limb for one with a different geometry, giving a different position to the end of arm tool. The robot soon learnt how cope with its changed circumstances to achieve the goals to 100% accuracy.
https://youtu.be/4dp_iiESLo8 Professor Lipson and his PHD student Robert Kwiatkowski, are aware of the ethical implications. “Self-awareness will lead to more resilient and adaptive systems, but also implies some loss of control,” they warn. “It’s a powerful technology, but it should be handled with care.” The ethical debate about the march of Artificial Intelligence can sometimes be pretty lively. Artificial Intelligence has already proven itself in many ways, successfully used by big business such as Facebook or Amazon, such organisations as Google Deepmind and Boston Dynamics are bringing real world benefits to robotics. However, as yet, there seems to be no evidence that AI can achieve anything without a great deal of hand holding from humans.
This step on the road to robot self-awareness undoubtedly brings us closer to potential dystopian futures, predicted in movies such as “2001: A Space Odyssey” or Skynet’s Judgement Day in “The Terminator”, and warnings by such eminent thought leaders as Professor Stephen Hawking should always be born in mind.
“The primitive forms of artificial intelligence we already have, have proved very useful. But I think the development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race… Humans, who are limited by slow biological evolution, couldn’t compete, and would be superseded.” The Columbia University research gives the robot its body image and allows it to learn how to use the information to achieve its goals. Luckily for us, it’s still humans setting those goals. We can debate what true self-awareness means but with no signs yet of AI learning to change the agenda, no emergence of self-determination, we seem safe for a good while yet.
Production businesses that make use of the technology will quickly gain a competitive advantage, so with Darwinian certainty, the exponential progress of this field is inevitable.
Active8 Robots uses Machine Learning algorithms in agile robotic solutions for customers who are benefiting from these advances, but doesn’t expect to be integrating self-aware robots for some time.

Application: Commemorative and collectible coin colour printing and quality inspection.
Problem: Inconsistent and subjective quality control process reliant on human vision.
Solution: Automated unguarded collaborative robot cell integrated with existing machinery to: locate and orientate coins into position placing into printing device; delicately remove freshly printed coins; closely inspect for blemishes imperceptible to the human eye; and grade for standardised approval or rejection.
Technologies: Rethink Robotics Sawyer.
Two Keyence vision systems.
Bespoke multifunction end of arm tool by Active8 Robots.
The Full Story QC Automation for Mint Condition Coins As the demand for commemorative and collectable coins surges across the globe, so does the demand for pristine quality. To exceed the high expectations of the discerning customer, the most stringent QC standards must be met.
A technically advanced mint production facility requires the use of the best possible technologies to achieve the desired level of quality inspection. For one coin, medal and bullion producer, using the outdated naked eye method to identify imperceptible imperfections for an exclusive series of colour enhanced coins marking a special anniversary was no longer adequate. Active8 Robots was invited to: · carry out an in-depth appraisal of the facility; · to produce an authoritative report detailing recommendations, implications, projections and benefits; · set out the roadmap for achieving the vision.
The primary goal was to improve the existing quality inspection control process beyond current standards without compromising production rates.
Secondary goals included: enhancing manufacturing speeds; reducing labour dependency and associated costs; and automating the dull repetitive tasks performed by humans to enable redeployment to roles that were more cognitive and variable in nature.
Upon review of the proposal presented by Active8 Robots it was eagerly accepted that all of the above would be satisfied with the designed solution. The engineering team was subsequently invited to develop the automated robotic press tending solution and integrate it with the coin producer’s existing systems.
This innovative pad-printing cell comprised a fully safe, unguarded collaborative robot system that could be loaded with up to eight hours of product whilst running unattended. It incorporated triple-function end-of-arm-tooling to maximise productive robot movement and two high-end vision systems by Keyence – one for sending data to the robot and the other for quality inspection. Multiple programs were specially developed to accommodate a wide range of coin sizes and designs.
How it works · The robot picks a tray of coins from the infeed rack and places it in the pick inspection jig.
· The first vision system, located above the tray, finds a valid target coin and sends location co-ordinates and rotary orientation data to the robot.
· Using a vacuum suction cup, the coin is picked from the top face and placed into an orientation jig to correct rotational alignment.
· The coin is re-picked and placed into the pad-printing vice for printing.
· On completion of the print cycle, the coin is delicately removed from the vice using a two-finger pneumatic parallel gripper, that picks it from the sides to avoid damaging the freshly printed surface.
· The coin passes through the second vision station that carries out quality control checks for colour variation and saturation, image position, paint smudges, shadowing, scratches, dirt and grease · Finally, the coin is judged to be either a pass or a fail and is subsequently placed in the corresponding outfeed.
The Outcome The bespoke solution designed, built and fully integrated by the Active8 Robots engineering team, successfully removed the need for an operative to carry out quality control using the outdated and subjective visual inspection method. The key advantage of using sophisticated machine vision systems for inspection is that the quality check process is objective, consistent and reliable. This resulted in better consistency of output quality, faster cycle times and lower labour costs.
Furthermore, the seamless integration and handover process minimised disruption to the business.
The mint producer can relax in the knowledge that are providing their customers with the quality that they expect and deserve worldwide.

Active8 Robots team of automation engineers has been using rapid prototyping techniques and manufacturing expertise to produce PPE (Personal Protective Equipment).
The Need for Face Shields There is a global shortage of Face Shields for use in hospitals, care homes and other residential establishments, not only for the treatment of COVID-19 patients but also to prevent it from spreading to the vulnerable.
Those providing front line care need  protection from patients coughing and sneezing, thereby distributing infected respiratory droplets. Even though many individuals and groups are designing and manufacturing batch face shield frames, many designs are not optimised thus limiting scalability and in some cases cannot be accessed locally without the availability of 3D printers.
Active8 Robots Approach With years of experience in 3D printing and adaptive manufacturing, Active8 Robots optimise a face mask frame design for 3D printing and started producing masks for distribution to local health care providers. However, despite having a great many adaptive printers at its disposal the company quickly realised that, with a print time for a mask frame in excess of 2hrs, would create a significant production bottle neck and a solution to speed up the process was needed. This resulted into an investigation and acceptance of a widely used rapid prototyping technique RTV (Room Temperature Vulcanisation) Silicone Moulding.
RTV Silicone Moulding The use of RTV is attractive because of the low outlay and the wide global availability of the raw materials required. RTV Moulding, with Industrial RTV silicone formulations, are widely available online and commonly found in craft shops and hardware outlets.
Making parts out of these materials requires a master mould, which can easily be made out of a wide variety of materials including plastic.
RTV silicone will cure at ambient temperatures, (albeit over hours), so to speed up the process, the company used an oven to accelerate the curing process.
Visor Supporting Frame Production Once sufficient silicone moulds have been produced a casting resin and hardener are mixed together (with any colouring additive required) and poured into the moulds for curing. In our tests in excess of 50 masks frames can be produced from one mould without any noticeable signs of wear to the mould.
Scaling Up Mask Shield | 3D Printer Vs RTV Silicone Moulding It costs far less to produce silicone moulds (typically under £10) which in turn are used to manufacture the visor parts than it does to acquire and scale up 3D printers (costing several hundreds of pounds) thereby making it more scalable and accessible without the requirement of any specialised knowledge.

What is certain however, is that at 11pm local time on March 29 th 2019, the UK is scheduled to leave the EU. Still to be decided is what precisely will happen on Brexit day, what kind of deal, if any, Britain will leave with and the final destination of the negotiations. Many are predicting a Hard Brexit, and in anticipation of this, UK manufacturers should be preparing for this change.
With no certainty yet over trade tariffs, freedom of movement for workers, or safety legislation, what could be the impact for British manufacturers? A proactive approach to a hard Brexit could help to cement Britain’s future in international markets, by encouraging them to utilise industry 4.0 technologies. British manufacturers have faced difficult economic times in the past, but they are now at a critical point. Brexit does however, present opportunities as well as threats, as manufacturers must now focus on their future markets, technologies and potential trade partners.
Antony, the Managing Director of Active8 Robots has previously said that “We should get on with dealing with what we do know, no matter what happens with Brexit, we know we will be competing in a worldwide market and now is a critical time for large and small businesses to get competitive”.
A recent report published by Sheffield Hallam University and SSG Insight, makes 3 key recommendations: Manufacturers should plan for the most disruptive Brexit outcome to mitigate the immediate structural changes triggered by the UK leaving the EU.
Technology should be harnessed to ensure that British manufacturers compete and thrive with their new trading partners.
Strategies for the continuous upskilling of employees should be developed to ensure British manufacturers keep pace with technological innovation.
The UK currently employs a lot of temporary labour, for simple tasks such as packing and picking. As a result of the Brexit vote we are in danger of losing this workforce, so many firms are now looking for a back-up strategy. More and more companies are setting aside a budget for automation. Although the UK has been slow to adopt robotics, its approach to automation is now changing, and this could be due to Brexit.
John Glen, Economist, Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply (CIPS), says that businesses should begin considering ways which will help them improve the efficiency of their supply chain, such as embracing new technologies and automating processes. Accelerating the implementation of automation in industry could allow for the scaling up of manufacturing volume, which could enable businesses to meet potential demands from global markets. The technology is also expected to help drive down the cost of production to enable Britain to compete with global prices, and to allow efficient adaption and development of new products and strategies for new trade partners.
“Collaborative Robots are a quick win for productivity, with an average ROI of 6-8 months” says Antony, MD of Active8 Robots. It gives the UK more of a chance within the worldwide productivity race. “Productivity isn’t everything but in the long run it is almost everything,” said Paul Krugman, the Nobel Prize-winning economist, in 1994.
However, it is important to remember that humans will not become obsolete. Cobots will allow the UK to make products better and less expensive, which will enable the UK to win an increased market share and be more profitable, which will in turn lead to more jobs for humans.
Active8 Robots helps businesses by using a new generation of Collaborative Robots.These are a type of robot designed to work collaboratively in their environment. They are small, inexpensive and able to work alongside people without huge cages. This means that smaller parts of a production line can be easily automated, allowing businesses to use their staff for more important tasks and the robots just work away at the dull bits. Automation is therefore, now in reach of small and medium business. Offering a complete service, from site surveys to installation, tool supply, design & manufacture, along with all the training and support, Active8 Robots is the only company to offer a full package end to end for its customers.
Active8 robots has worked with many businesses small and large, most often in production, co-packing and the higher education sectors having robots in dozens of universities and research establishments nationwide.

So, while I have your attention, let’s have a quick look at the key differences between the traditional idea of robots and cobots.
Naturally, the kind of robots Hollywood shows us and the kind of robots factory workers are used to are two very different things, so just to clarify, we’re going to be talking about the differences between traditional factory robots and cobots.
Firstly and most importantly, cobots are built to be so safe they can work alongside people without there being a risk. Classical industrial robots are often very large and very fast and as a result, are kept behind guards to protect the humans working in the same area. With a cobot this is eliminated entirely as they are specifically designed to work together with people rather than for them.
Secondly, robots are often programmed to do one job and repeat it continuously, whereas cobots can learn by demonstration and can be easily reprogrammed to learn a new job. Also with the ever-growing range of End of Arm Tools available, changing the nature of the job is simple.
Next and a really big advantage of using cobots instead of a more traditional robot is that they are lightweight and easy to move around, most of them can be mounted to any surface and are light enough to be moved by just one person. As mentioned before, traditional factory robots are contained in cages and are difficult to install and move around.
Moving on from that point, because they’re so easy to move around and teach, cobots see a much quicker return on investment. Though of course, it also helps that they’re significantly cheaper than most industrial robots.
Finally, the most important, cobots are generally a lot more fun to look at than your traditional robot. Who wants to look at a large metallic spider-like machine when instead you can have a Rethink Robotics’ Sawyer robot with its friendly looking face or a UR arm with its fashionable colour scheme?
Now you’re a little more clued up on the differences between robots and cobots, can you think of any other key differences to add to the list?

With Gazebo, they can all write their code, run it through the simulator, and then, without changing application code, test it on Sawyer. This allows more people to work offline, while reducing the load on the real robot. It’s great for Researchers and Students who want to write and test application in a virtual environment.
New Motion Interface – This mode allows the user to specify high-level (Joint or Cartesian space) waypoints. Sawyer’s own onboard motion controller will then generate smooth trajectories that will interpolate motion between these waypoints. This development lowers the barriers for motion planning for programmers without a full robotics background.
Impedance and Force control mode interfaces – Users can more quickly take advantage of our built-in torque sensors on each joint – a unique differentiator — to use force and impedance control with the robot. Impedance control allows you to directly control the Cartesian stiffness of the endpoint. Force control enables the robot to exert forces and moments in the six Cartesian dimensions.
This release is expected in March 2018.
Active End of Arm Tools – To support you and the Sawyer, Active Robots have a family of gripper kits. Now, you can choose any of our 4 grippers (Foam, Vacuum, Compliant and Parallel). This quickly expands the types of parts and materials you can pick up/move with minimal effort.

Because the robot is inherently safe it can be used without the need for safety cages and extensive Health and Safety reviewing so that users can get up close and personal with the robot from the start.
Collaborative Robots are the Future Smart, collaborative robots which can work alongside people like humans do are the future of efficient manufacturing and now is the time to engage students and lead them to a path towards robotics and engineering. Only now is importance being emphasised on STEM subjects and STEM workshops but it would appear that the Western World is already falling behind the Far East in implementing collaborative robotics in education and manufacturing.
Usable by all ages Baxter can be used by all ages, starting with Primary school children all the way through to Post-Doctoral Researchers such is its ease of use and level of safety. This means that Baxter can be used for STEM classroom teaching, robotics and electrical engineering lab work, academic research as well as University outreach and promotion purposes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU9tvBtqQTc Why Baxter?
If Baxter’s unique safety features , impressive hardware and incredible price aren’t reason enough, Baxter has more to offer away from the robot itself. Unlike other platforms Baxter can be used with both Gazebo and MoveIt, an Open Source simulator, and integrated planning and visualisation environment, which can be installed on multiple machines without the burden of software subscriptions and yearly renewal charges. By being able to write and test code offline, and then use the same code on Baxter, time with Baxter is much more productive. This means that multiple users can simultaneously plug and play with Baxter to test their coding and programming. Baxter allows direct programming access via the open-source Robot Operating System (ROS) and there are also a variety of programming languages which can be used such as Python, C++, Java, MATLAB and .Net.
Flexibility Across Uses Because Baxter can be used for teaching, research and outreach there is likely to be great demand for the robot and with typical systems user accounts and settings would have to be created and managed, with Baxter there is no need. Once one user disconnects their work from Baxter, its then ready for the next and downtime is eliminated. This means that you don’t need to restart the robot or change settings and permissions between users which saves a lot of time and hassle for both students and teachers alike.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBfetcZwIdQ Baxter is a revolution in collaborative robotics and is the modern day power tool, here to better equip individuals and businesses alike to work more productively and efficiently. By equipping students with the most advanced robotics technology at an early life gives them the best possible opportunities for the future, not only for them but for the businesses they work for.

The ORMi family has been specially designed to take the hard work out of AGV, AMR and AIV development, so you can go from build-to-bot fast.
The time-consuming tasks normally associated with sourcing components, determining compatibility, configuring hardware and programming software has been taken care of by us, for you.
Mobile robot design has never been made easier!
Ready-to-assemble component kit A comprehensive and fully compatible range of the fundamental components required to build your mobile robot from scratch. All parts are selected, tried and tested by our engineers for performance and reliability.
Pre-assembled & pre-wired component kit A part-built unit comprising ORMi KIT with additional mechanical and electrical components all pre-wired and mounted onto a stainless steel baseplate by our engineers, all set for you to continue the build and integrate with your own chassis.
Built & configured functioning unit A mobile unit comprising ORMi WIRED fixed to a robust aluminium chassis with servo motors, mounting brackets, batteries and wheels with options for all payloads up to 2000kg. A ready-to-GO platform primed by our engineers.
CE Marked engineered system & accompanying training program Need a complete solution?
For more demanding or complex projects we can design, build and configure a complete system to match your exacting specification. We will also deliver a comprehensive training program covering all aspects of safety, operation and maintenance.
Product Brochure Download The ORMi family is a flagship innovation for AMR, AGV and AIV development. Here are just a few reasons why you should go ORMi.
LOW COST Save tens of thousands of pounds on a mobile robot with a low capital outlay compared to buying an off-the-shelf product.
TIME SAVING Gain weeks or months to spend on the development work that really matters instead of wasting valuable time on mundane tasks.
CUSTOMISABLE Adapt your ORMi to meet the specific needs of your application and to overcome any unexpected challenges.
LOW RISK Build up your mobile robotics R&D knowledge and expertise, economically, in a market where experience is in short supply.
COMPATIBLE Build-a-bot with tried and tested industry proven parts that you know are going to work together seamlessly.
TECH MADE EASY Simplify the complex with just one controller, which can be operated from practically anything - PLC, joystick and radio controls, push buttons etc.
CONVENIENT Choose which stage of the development process is best for you to start from with three options from the ORMi family.
EASY TO INTEGRATE Ease the coding process with a powerful setup and monitoring PC utility, sample scripts, APIs, ROS drivers and simulator.
PEACE OF MIND Benefit from our free technical advisory service where help is always on hand to keep your project on track and in budget.
ORMi is commonly used for industry 4.0 initiatives and lean transformation. For example, a tugger for the high-volume repetitive movement of goods or a reach truck for lifting or lowering heavy loads in confined spaces.
ORMi can also be used in specialist applications such as a danger detection tool in zones with no existing guiding infrastructure or as a moving platform for laser scanning. ORMi can be developed into any number of permutations and can handle both light-duty and heavy-duty tasks.
AIV (Autonomous Intelligent Vehicle) AGV (Automated Guided Vehicle) AMR (Autonomous Mobile Robot) UGV (Unmanned Ground Vehicle) Unmanned combat robot Automated pallet truck Automated reach truck Automated stacker Performance data comparison View table Additional items that you might need to complete your project will vary according to the performance criteria of the intended application. For example, a UVC disinfection unit will require a lamp whereas a bomb defusing unmanned ground vehicle may require haptic feedback functionality. Some of the more basic factors to consider when designing your mobile robot include the following.
Power Battery type, size and capacity will differ according to your ORMi’s appetite for power and whether it will be fully charged overnight or micro-charged in between jobs. Consideration should also be given to the docking station network if there is a need to have more than one.
Navigation If your ORMi’s development path is the AGV route, it might need tape for magnetic navigation or reflectors for laser guided navigation. If it is the AMR route, then cameras, laser scanners and software all might be on the to-buy list. All variations will require sensors.
Chassis Our engineers can design and build a custom chassis if required. Moving small parts from one workstation to the next may only need a lightweight construction yet handling volatile substances in a hostile environment will need something more robust.
Safety Whatever your mobile robot form (AGV, AMR, AIV, UGV etc), it will need an appropriate system that meets the relevant standards and complies with any applicable regulatory requirements. This may comprise both active safety elements e.g. pressure sensors, and passive devices e.g. audible alarms.
Software The ORMi family comes with software comprising PC utilities, simulators, tools, APIs and drivers that allows you to customise functionality using basic language scripts. For more complex applications, or if you want a more user-friendly interface, you may consider alternative software architecture.
Special Parts The ORMi family has been designed such that it provides a standard development platform, not a finished mobile robot. This gives the designer the freedom and flexibility to design and build a specialised AMR, AGV or AIV, which may require non-standard parts for example, bespoke robotic arm tooling.

Well, look out for Industry 5.0!
16 January 2018 By Antony Lovedale Just as we all started embracing Industry 4.0 now the new buzz word is Industry 5.0, which focuses on the interaction between humans and machines, something we’re already seeing with collaborative robots and the smart technologies that we’ve all come to recognise. While many people are concerned that the integration of Industry 4.0 will spell the end of many jobs in manufacturing, Industry 5.0 seems to be pushing towards more advanced human-automation collaboration, which would see improved integration allowing automated product lines combined with the power of human intelligence. So in reality, robots aren’t likely to be taking over your factories and stealing your jobs anytime soon, instead giving more of an emphasis on collaborative working.
Many integrators are starting to shout about Industry 5.0 and how it can improve productivity without removing jobs completely or leaving the entire workplace to be run by robots, instead creating roles, like technicians and engineers to help keep the automotive aspect moving.
While Industry 4.0 is still the forefront of cutting edge manufacturing, we should always be looking to the future and moving forwards, finding new innovative ways to getting maximum efficiency.
How will Industry 5.0 affect your workplace? Are you willing to embrace those changes?

It is sensitive, interconnected, adaptive and cost-effective.
The Panda almost seems too good to be true; a robot that is delivered in one box, is straightforward to set up, and easy to program. But just because it can be set up as easily as one, Panda is definitely not a toy. Franka Emika’s Panda is so precise that it can actually help assemble and build other Panda robots. This cobot can not only work safely alongside people but is also surprisingly dexterous; it can open and close bags, and even use cable ties. Franka could even learn to paint, DJ or play a board game.
Strictly speaking, Panda is a robot assistant, as its speciality is working alongside humans. It is very sensitive to touch, can be guided with one hand, and avoids collisions. Panda consists of the Arm and Control, the Pilot and the Hand with exchangeable Fingers, and a full software framework ranging from low-level mechatronics control to the highly intuitive app-based programming environment “Desk”.
Desk is an intuitive interface that can run on all web browsers and does not require software installation. In Desk you can easily program a task for Panda to complete, by arranging available Apps, and configuring them via the Pilot or your input device. Then, simply press “Run” and Panda carries out the task for you.
The Panda boasts torque sensors in all seven of its joints which gives “human like arm agility and sensitivity.” It also has an 80cm reach with a 3kg payload, and 0.1 mm accuracy. While there are other cobots on the market with similar specs to this, it is the unique combination of simple app-based programming and the ability to carry out challenging tasks that makes the Panda a real competitor in the cobot market.

These costs, coupled with the inflexibility that traditional automation solutions offered has led most companies to continue with employing a core of manufacturing staff which they ‘top up’ with seasonal and temp workers.
This has led to many businesses offshoring to countries, such as China, who have far lower production costs, mainly due to lower wages, in order to save money in an increasingly competitive marketplace.
What needs do businesses have?
(Click to expand) [bg_faq_start] Minimise costs Rationalise overheads by reducing reliance on seasonal and temporary workers within the manufacturing operations of the business. The ability to implement an automation solution in a reasonable timescale and budget.
Retain domestic manufacturing Minimise the need to offshore and keep jobs and manufacturing within the domestic market to increase control and quality in the supply chain.
Increase manufacturing flexibility Businesses increasingly have to deal with ever changing demands from the marketplace which can often necessitate the need for rapid re-deployment and change within manufacturing operations. Traditional automation solutions are very inflexible, large amounts of time and money are spent to programme them to a task and it’s not a very easy process to change even the smallest adjustment.
Reduce training and downtime By relying on temp staff there is an inherent amount of induction and training time spent with each person. There is also the associated downtime as when you’re training staff, they’re not being productive. Also, with traditional industrial automation, there is large amount of downtime spent by an external engineer re-programming the robots to their new task which is both costly and time consuming.[bg_faq_end] Enter the Smart, Collaborative Robot Robots like Baxter are not an evolution of an existing line of robots, they are a revolution in low cost automation. By working with businesses to identify their needs and working alongside them, Rethink Robotics are producing robots like Baxter which are constantly evolving to improve and deliver more for businesses.
Innovative design and efficient construction has reduced the unit cost of Baxter to only £19,000 (22,000€) to realise Rodney Brooks’ dream of introducing low cost robotic solutions in every workplace. The inherent safety systems designed within the hardware and software of Baxter makes it safe for humans to work alongside, without the need for safety cages and without extensive health and safety reviews. Baxter conforms to ISO 10218, the International standard for industrial robotics.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCML42boO8c Baxter is trained, not programmed to operate like humans do and there is no reliance on expensive systems programmers. Empower your workforce so they are able to train Baxter themselves in as little as 5 minutes, Baxter is the power tool of the 21st century and all modern workforces should be equipped with a low cost automation solution.
Intera 3 , the latest software release for Baxter, has doubled the accuracy and speed of Baxter though software configurations alone. It also includes features such as the Robot Positioning System to further decrease downtime and the need for re-training across operations.
By utilising smart, collaborative robots for a low cost automation solution the need to offshore is minimised, overheads can be reduced effectively without effecting productivity and can lead to higher value re-deployment of staff within the business.

With the struggles of Brexit on the horizon, for many SMEs, this could be the difference between sinking and swimming.
The report criticised the Department for Business Innovation and Skills (BIS) and the Treasury for failing to provide adequate information on how SMEs can access funding.
BIS Schemes The main six existing BIS schemes provide support to more than 6000 firms each year. The Treasury’s Funding for Lending scheme has also provided £17.6 billion of cheaper lending to banks, with the intention that they will pass this on to businesses and households.
Despite this, many businesses are still unaware of, or unable to access, this finance due to a lack of public awareness. As a result, many SMEs are relying on credit cards and overdrafts for financial support.
Margaret Hodge, chairwoman of the PAC, told the Independent: “Small and medium-sized enterprises have a vital role to play in driving the UK’s economic recovery, but despite government attempts to encourage lending to SMEs, many still struggle to access the finance they need. Departments were therefore unable to demonstrate that they are achieving best value for taxpayers’ money.
Automation is a key opportunity for increasing productivity within your business. Making use of these accessible loans could make automation an even more viable solution for your factory. On top of this, many of Active8 Robots’ solutions have a short payback period of just 18-24 months, meaning that the loans need not be long term.
Be sure to contact the Active8 Robots team if you think an automated solution could be what your factory needs.
Tips for Accessing Funding- County Councils Harang your county council, ask them what they are doing to help, they will often have schemes and events to bring companies and financers in their region together, but these are often poorly advertised. For example, Greater Manchester have the https://www.businessgrowthhub.com/ service.
Asset finance Financing automation can be particularly attractive to asset financing companies.  In general the lending is against the value of the object being purchased.  The value of other assets already on the balance sheet can also be taken into account to reduce risk further. Another option might be for the finance company to lease the assets to the applicant until their value is paid, when a final payment transfers ownership.
With this form of financing, the lower the risk to the lenders the lower the cost of borrowing. If you have assets on your balance sheet that could help you raise finance this may be worth considering.
Equity finance This that you are selling shares in your company to inject funds. Equity finance is typically used by fast growing companies to finance investments that have a longer-term return. Equity investments are typically available to the company for the long-term and, unlike debt finance, are not paid back.
4. Crowdfunding Crowdfunding is all the buzz in startup circles, but it’s also being used by small businesses to expand. According to the crowdfunding platform Kickstarter, $349 million has been successfully pledged and invested in projects on that site alone. With some intelligent marketing you have the ability to get your idea in front of hundreds, even thousands of potential backers.

This week saw the launch of a Space X Dragon robotic cargo freighter from the Kennedy space centre at Cape Canaveral with 2,617 kilograms of supplies, experiments and hardware for the space station and its six-person crew.
Also aboard is a new home for RELL, Robotic External Leak Locator. Spacecraft rely on extensive cooling systems, just as coolant in a car is used to cool the engine, ammonia is circulated through a huge system of pumps, reservoirs and radiators on station to cool its complex life support systems, spacecraft equipment and science experiments. RELL is a “sniffer,” robot that helps mission operators detect the location of external ammonia leaks on space station and rapidly confirm a successful repair.
The RELL design includes two sensors: a mass spectrometer and a total pressure gauge.
The mass spectrometer measures the number of molecules present in any molecular mass to create a “mass spectrum” reading. Based on this data, analysts determine the composition of present gases. The mass spectrometer can distinguish between trace orbital gasses, which occur naturally, and chemicals potentially originating on station, such as ammonia. This tool can tell the difference from a football field length away.
The total pressure gauge measures the total pressure in space. After the general vicinity of a leak is known, the pressure gauge is able to pinpoint any leak to within a few inches in real time.
Keeping RELL inside the station takes up space that could be used for other scientific hardware and experiments. Additionally, the process of deploying RELL takes much longer when the tool is not externally stored. Operated remotely by mission controllers on the ground, RELL currently requires crew schedule and airlock availability to get it outside the station with the use of station’s Dextre Robotic arm.
Once outside the station, RELL currently needs to wait 12 hours in space before it can be used. This allows for RELL’s extremely sensitive gas analyser to clear itself of water vapour and other gases from inside the station, essentially giving the instruments a clean slate. Because of this extensive process, it could take multiple weeks or even months from the time a leak is suspected, to the time RELL is deployed, to then find out where it is coming from. RELL is such a low cost tool, with mostly off the shelf robotic sensing components that NASA are having two and with the new Robotics Tool Stowage, RiTS, this entire process would only depend on Dextre’s availability, greatly expediting the search for leaks.
“For each of its stored tools, RiTS will provide heat and physical protection from radiation and micrometeroids, or tiny, high-speed objects hurtling through space,” said Mark Neuman, RiTS hardware manager. “Its thermal system maintains ideal temperatures for the instruments, helping them stay functional.” Having this housing unit in place will also help the space station’s robotic arm, Dextre, easily locate, grab and put back these important tools.
RiTS spacewalk install procedures being tested in the Neutral Buoyancy Lab at NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston.
Human and robotic collaborations like these are considered important for upcoming space exploration plans, including potential exploration of the Moon, Mars and beyond. For example, RiTS and RELL’s capabilities could be employed to detect potential leaks occurring from future human habitats on lunar and other planetary surfaces, as well as the Lunar Gateway.
As with all good robotics installations, this robotic tool and the new stowage mean that the cost of leak detection has been reduced significantly, it is faster, more reliable and is future relevant.

28 November 2018 By Antony Lovedale Active8 Robots is extremely aware that every manufacturing line is different, and one standard solution cannot be made to increase productivity in every line. However, it can be said that many manufacturing lines have similar problems where productivity can be increased. Because of this, Active8 Robots has developed some Off-The-Shelf solutions that can help many different factories.
We have created the Attollo Series Palletiser, The Box Erector, and The Tray Erector. Each one fixes a common problem in manufacturing lines, and can be slightly modified for each order, to work within the desired line.
The Attollo Series Palletiser The Attollo Series Palletiser is a compact and reliable automated palletiser. Attollo’s easy to program software and mobility mean it offers speed and flexibility when setting up a production line making it ideal for long or short production runs. The Attollo reduces labour costs and lowers health and safety risks associated with manual handling. It is safe to use being fully guarded, with pallet entry and box in-feed light guarded for ease of access. Its easy to program software enables users to manage complex pallet layers that can be easily configured without specialist programming knowledge. This means it can be easily programmed each time the size of box being palletised changes.
The Box Erector The Box Erector directly addresses a need of many manufacturing lines, its benefits are clear and it is an excellent product for the packaging industry. With a small footprint, low cost, and fast payback the Box Erector can fulfil the needs of many different packaging lines. On top of this it is not designed for one specific box, but instead can erect boxes of many different sizes, offering agile automation which will enable manufacturers to continue using the product when their line changes in the future.
The Tray Erector Active8 Robots’ Tray Erector is a dual tool robot automated solution, tooled to fit a single tray size. It incorporates a smart collaborative robot which allows for uncaged operation around personnel. The tray size that the application is programmed to fit can be changed upon implementation, making it flexible to more than one specific manufacturing line.
Active8 Robots has developed these solutions with manufacturers in mind, especially those in the packaging industry. We have witnessed these problems first-hand in many different factories and believe that with the agile nature of our solutions they could be implemented in many different businesses with varying boxes, trays and products.
Be sure to contact us now to find out how any of these products could benefit your business!

The AR10 Humanoid Hand and Surveyor Robot were crowd favourites with numerous people taking the time to stop by our stand and talk to us.
We had lots of people on our stand coming to look at the new AR10 Humanoid Robot Hand and also the Surveyor Robot proved popular with lots of people connecting to it with their smartphones and taking it for a drive, good job we brought 3 along!
We also managed to find the time to meet some of our partners such as Rethink Robotics , Mathworks and Aldebaran and  and even had time for a catch up with Rodney Brooks who was giving a keynote speech on factories of the future, in-case you missed it here is a taste of Rodney’s engaging presentation style in his TED Talk on ‘Why we will rely on robots.’ Aldebaran brought Pepper along to InnoRobo, after selling 1000 units in Japan in less than a minute it was sure to be popular but we managed to sneak a photo with Pepper along with Michael and Adrien from Aldebaran.
Mathworks announced at InnoRobo that the MatLab ROS Robot Systems Toolbox will be unveiled in the UK on the 7th October at the 2015 MatLab Expo at Silverstone, Northamptonshire. This toolbox will create a whole new synergy between Baxter and MatLab to bring a whole range of subjects to life.
Rethink Robotics also announced the impending release of a series of curriculum content for Baxter in the areas of Robotics, Kinematics and Computer Vision. This open source curriculum will be free to access and use by all Baxter robot users and will be hosted as part of the existing Baxter community through the online Wiki pages. Curriculum is set to include lecture notes, handouts, practical tasks and examples of student projects to really get Baxter up and running straight out of the box.
We’re looking forward to InnoRobo 2016 and also to our next show, in Hamburg from 28th September – 2nd October.

No Ocado staff are believed to be injured but there is little hope for the robots trapped inside.
Questions will surely be raised about why the robots did not respond to fire systems and make their way to safety.

Previously, this toothpaste tube de-palletisation and loading application was heavily reliant on manual labour, causing bottlenecks in the production process. This manual process was disjointed, with a single operator attempting to complete numerous sequential tasks. With a requirement to meet a cycle time of 48 seconds per box, the new automation solution features one collaborative robot, selected for its payload and reach characteristics.
In operation, it de-palletises the boxes of tubes and presents to an infeed conveyor system, feeding into a tube-filling machine. The box is deposited on a custom fixture where the cobot positions the box while utilising force detection capabilities. This compensates for any variation in the box position on the pallet, to ensure that the final position is the same for each box. The box is clamped on the fixture as a vacuum nozzle is introduced to remove the plastic sheet, while the robot removes the box lid and deposits to a conveyor that feeds the existing recycling conveyor. The box is finally manipulated to the infeed conveyor using a pneumatic pusher. Optical sensors are used to check for the removal of plastic sheets from within the box and safety sensors are integrated with the system to influence the robot running speeds for various conditions, based on operator proximity, mitigating the need for physical guarding. The safety sensors were utilised for this solution to comply with the customer’s policy for no operator to come into contact with moving machinery.

SME’s have been left with few options with most choosing to offshore and get part, or all of their manufacturing in lower labour cost countries such as China and Korea.
However, there is now a viable option for SME’s to enable them to automate their business, take back control of their manufacturing and supply chain whilst reducing operating costs, all with a typical ROI of 12 months or less with a smart, collaborative robot!
We’ve collated a range of case studies detailing how a variety of manufacturers have made use of low cost automation using robots.
Typical reasons for automation are to: increase output maximise efficiency increase flexibility reduce overheads have more dynamic manufacturing gain a technological advantage over competitors enable re-deployment of staff to higher value tasks [bg_faq_start] Standby Screw Machine Products Co Leveraging Baxter in two separate applications to increase flexibility and consistency in manufacturing operations and to better compete on a global stage. They have saved over 2000 machine tending man hours which has been better utilised in higher skilled employment.
