Hardware Acceleration solutions for the robotics architect pg. 60 Robotic Processing Units pg. 61 T ools and Robot IP Cores pg. 62 References 6 Hardware Acceleration Report in Robotics2022 7 Executive Summary 8 Robots are deterministic machines. Meeting time deadlines in their computations (real-time) is the most important feature however other characteristics are also of relevance while designing robotic computations including the time between the start and the completion of a task (latency), the total amount of work done in a given time (bandwidth or throughput) or that a task happens in exactly the same timeframe, each time (determinism). CPUs are widely used in robotics due to their availability however they hardly provide real-time and safety guarantees while delivering high throughput. Hardware acceleration ( with either FPGAs, GPUs or other accelerators) presents an answer to this problem. One that allows the robotics architect to create custom computing architectures for robots that comply with real-time and bandwidth requirements, while lowering power consumption.
Hardware acceleration has the potential to revolutionize robotics, enabling new applications by speeding up robot response times while remaining power-efficient. However, the diversity of acceleration options makes it difficult for roboticists to select the right computational resource for each task. This report captures the state-of-the art of hardware acceleration in robotics by following a quantitative approach and presents robotic architects with a resource to consider while designing their robot computational architectures. The report compares the most popular computation solutions in robotics used today through reproducible and Acceleration Working Group GitHub organization.
Since most companies building real robots today use ROS or similar event-driven software frameworks, this report uses ROS as the common baseline in robotics to conduct the study (section 2.2). In particular, we framework for robot application development and consider both bandwidth and latency to benchmark performance in robotics (section 2.3) using a grey-box and non-functional benchmarking approach (section 2.4).
9 Hardware Acceleration Report in Robotics2022 The work presented in this report happened in two phases. First, a community survey conducted in both the ROS and the overall robotics communities helped grasp the interest behind the use of hardware acceleration in robotics.
Input from this community survey was then used to drive the second phase, a hardware acceleration benchmarking effort. The most relevant results from these two phases are summarized below: Community Survey Only about half of the respondents (51%, section 3 .1 ) is confident about the value and differences between hardware acceleration solutions for robotics: Only 62.5% (section 3.2) have ever programmed an acceleration kernel.
This suggests that there’s still a lot of work to be done from silicon vendors’ side to further simplify the use and integration of their solutions.
The majority of the roboticists currently use GPUs (69.8%, section 3. 11) versus FPGAs (21.9%): Roboticists seem to care about speed or latency (48.9%, shorter execution time) as much as real-time and determinism (46.8%). Only a reduced 4.3% would prioritize power consumption (section 3. 10).
This indicates that there’s margin for FPGA usage growth in the ROS robotics community .
When asked about the most relevant aspects of hardware acceleration (section 3.3), 52. 1% of the roboticists that and its ecosystem of tools is of most relevance to them: 11.5%, colcon build tools 19.8% and acceleration firmware 20.8%).

10Results obtained across benchmarks performed on a of view optimized FPGA accelerators outperform their GPU counterparts, even when using powerful GPUs.
Considering mean runtime measurements (in ms, Figure 15, section 4.2), the use of a CPU + FPGA combination delivers a 3.56x speedup over a comparable CPU + GPU, and a 1.36x speedup over a comparable CPU.
When considering a more powerful CPU + GPU combination (Figure 17 , section 4.2), the FPGA still outperforms it with a 1.59x speedup.

T o discriminate between any possible differences between the CPU cores, measurements were collected isolating perception computations by infrastructure overhead, as well as the host-device (GPU or FPGA) data transfer overhead.
Popular perception algorithms such as the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) show a 500x speedup in an FPGA and relative to a comparable GPU (Figure 22).Benchmarking hardware acceleration 11 Hardware Acceleration Report in Robotics2022 11Figure 0 Performance-per- watt benchmark perception graph across various accelerators.

2.5 2 1.5 1 0.5 0 CPU + FPGA (KR260) CPU + FPGA ( Jetson Nano)CPU + GPU ( Jetson AGX Xavier) Overall, results hint that the rate at which the energy consumption grows with GPU solutions seems to be smaller than the rate at which the latency performance improves, which leads to a decaying performance-per- GPU + CPU solutions. Instead, FPGA-enabled solutions present a performance-per-watt figure that’s 6x ( 5.93x) better than the one observed in comparable GPU + CPU sets and 8x (7 .95x) better than the one in more power GPU + CPU sets.
These results indicate that using bandwidth as the only measure of performance can be misleading in ROS and robotics. Moreover, data suggests that when considering latency as the measure of performance, GPU sets may struggle to find themselves on equal footing with their FPGA counterparts.
There are nevertheless various advantages that GPUs inherently have and that should be considered while building complex robotic computations. Moreover, though FPGA kernel runtime execution outperforms their GPU counterparts, it’s relevant to note that FPGAs are resource-limited and thereby it’s important to consider that only a fixed set of accelerators would be able to fit within an FPGA at any given point in time whereas the GPUs don’t have this limitation due to their architectures.
Scalable robot compute architectures that consider hardware acceleration should look at combining CPUs, GPUs and FPGAs to obtain the best trade-off.
12 Hardware Acceleration Report in Robotics2022 13 Introduction 14The CPU whack-a-mole in robotics Robots are deterministic machines. Meeting time deadlines in their computations (real-time) is the most important feature however other characteristics are also of relevance while designing robotic computations including the time between the start and the completion of a task (latency), the total amount of work done in a given time (bandwidth or throughput) or that a task happens in exactly the same timeframe, each time (determinism).
There’s a critical relationship between the hardware and the software capabilities in a robot. Robotic systems usually have limited on-board resources, including memory , I/O, disk or compute capabilities, making it hard to balance between real-time and bandwidth requirements ( due to limited shared resources), and restricting robots’ reaction capabilities and speed. A key challenge in robotics using general purpose CPUs1 is that they hardly provide real-time and safety guarantees while delivering high throughput. The de facto strategy in industry [1 ] to meet timing deadlines is a laborious, empirical, and case-by-case tuning of the system. This “CPU whack-a-mole” approach in robotics is unsustainable and hard to scale due to the lack of a hardware-supported timing-safe event driven programming interface in CPUs.CPUs hardly provide real-time and safety guarantees while delivering high throughput.
This “CPU whack- a-mole” approach in robotics is unsustainable and hard to scale1 CPUs are widely used in commercial compute platforms in robotics due to their availability and generalized use. The general purpose nature of CPUs makes them specially interesting for roboticists to kickstart projects, however this comes at a cost when translating into real applications: their fixed architectures and limited amount of resources difficult adaptability to new ( computing) robotic scenarios and always impose a trade-off between performance and determinism.2 .1 15 Hardware Acceleration Report in Robotics2022 Hardware acceleration with dedicated compute architectures (in either FPGAs, GPUs or other accelerators) is presented as an alternative to CPUs.
One that allows the architect to adaptively generate custom computing architectures to meet the robotic computing demands, delivering a solution that can comply with real-time and bandwidth requirements while increasing reliability and lowering power consumption. Hardware acceleration is presented as an alternative to CPUs delivering a solution that can comply with real-time and bandwidth requirementsThis report presents robotic architects with a resource to consider while designing their robot computational architectures that describes how hardware acceleration can improve their performance. T o study the capabilities of hardware acceleration in robotics, this article follows a quantitative approach [2] to measure performance and compares the most popular hardware Results presented in this report are meant to be reproducible and disclosed as open source examples Acceleration Working Group GitHub organization repositories.
baseline in robotics Robot behaviors take the form of computational graphs, with data flowing between computation Nodes, across physical networks ( communication buses) and while mapping to underlying sensors and actuators. The popular choice to build these computational graphs for robots these days is the Robot Operating System (ROS) [3], a framework for robot application development. ROS enables you to build computational graphs and create robot behaviors by providing libraries, a communication infrastructure, drivers and tools to put it all together. Most companies building real robots today use ROS or similar event-driven software frameworks. ROS is thereby the common language in robotics, with several hundreds of companies and thousands of developers using it to address some of the challenges in ROS and solves many of the problems in building reliable robotics systems.
robot application development most silicon vendor solutions support, and with a variety of modular packages, each implementing a different robotics feature that simplifies performance benchmarking in robotics.2.2 17 Hardware Acceleration Report in Robotics2022 Bandwidth, latency and performance considerations The field of robotics is changing rapidly and must be studied with real examples and measurements on real robotic computations, rather than simply as a collection of definitions, designs and marketing actions. The quantitative approach [2] to robotics systems architecture fits well in this context and helps robotic architects come up with better performing architectures through an empirical strategy , and case-by-case tuning of the system.
In robotics bandwidth or throughput is the total amount of work done in a given time, such as the publication feed resulting from processing the data of a camera, or the second) of a processed point cloud coming from a depth sensor. In contrast, latency or response time is the time between the start and the completion of a task, such as T opic subscription in a computational graph.
When speaking about performance in robotics, both bandwidth and latency should be taken into consideration. In particular, given the importance of real- time in robotics we’ d generally be interested in the latency for performance benchmarking. 2.3 A final consideration is the bandwidth/latency performance improvement ratio in robotics. A simple rule of thumb in ( general) computation is that bandwidth grows by at least the square of the improvement in latency. Robotic architects should take this into consideration while designing their robotic systems.When speaking about performance in robotics, both bandwidth and latency should be taken in consideration 18Methodology for benchmarking performance Benchmarking is the act of running a computer program to assess its relative performance. In the context of hardware acceleration, it’s fundamental to assess the relative performance of an acceleration kernel versus its CPU scalar computing baseline. Similarly , benchmarking helps comparing acceleration kernels across hardware acceleration technology solutions ( e.g. FPGA_A vs FPGA_B or FPGA_A vs GPU_A, etc.) and across kernel implementations ( within the same hardware acceleration technology solution).
There’re different types of benchmarking approaches. The following diagram depicts the most popular inspired by [5] : Figure 1 Performance benchmarking approaches.

2 and its computational graph. If necessary , they should instrument the communications middleware and its underlying layers.
Intra-process, inter-process and intra-network: Measures conducted should consider communication within a process in the same SoC, between processes in an SoC and between different SoCs connected in the same network (intra-network).
Compute substrate-agnostic: benchmarks should be able to run on different hardware acceleration technology solutions. For that purpose, a CPU-centric framework (as opposed to an acceleration technology-specific framework) that can be integrated in various accelerators for benchmarking and/or tracing is the ideal choice.
Automated: benchmarks and related source code should be designed with automation in mind. Once ready , creating a benchmark and producing results should be (ideally ) a fully automated process.
Hardware farm mindset: benchmarks will be conducted on hardware embedded platforms sitting in a farm-like environment (redundancy of tests, multiple SoCs/boards) with the intent of validating and comparing different technologies.
Accounting for all of this, and similar to the ROS Enhancement Proposal (REP) REP-2008 proposal [6 ] , in this report we adopt a grey-box and non-functional benchmarking approach for hardware acceleration that allows to evaluate the relative complete computational graphs. T o realize it in a technology agnostic-manner, we select the Linux T racing T oolkit next generation (L TT ng) which will be used for tracing and benchmarking.Differences between tracing and benchmarking T racing and benchmarking can be better understood as follows: T racing: a technique used to understand what goes on in a running software system.
Benchmarking: a method of comparing the performance of various systems by running a common test.
From these definitions, inherently one can determine that both benchmarking and tracing are connected in the sense that the test/benchmark will use a series of measurements for comparison.
These measurements will come from tracing probes. In other words, tracing will collect data that will then be fed into a benchmark program for comparison.2 .4.1 20 Hardware Acceleration Report in Robotics2022 21 Community Survey 22Are you familiar with the different hardware acceleration solutions and their advantages (e.g. FPGAs vs GPUs) 96 answers 46,9% 51%3.1 Figure 2 Results from the “Hardware acceleration in survey” (link) question: “ Are you familiar with the different hardware acceleration solutions and their advantages Gazebo?

38Robotics perception helps sense the static and dynamic objects, and build a reliable and detailed representation of the robot’s environment using computer vision and machine learning techniques. Data obtained in a robot from its sensors like cameras and LIDAR is typically fed into the perception layer turning into something useful for decision making and planning physical actions. The perception layer in a robot is thereby responsible for object detection, segmentation and tracking.

With plenty of attendance in each one of its meetings12 and with the participation of multiple silicon vendors, the group is arguably one of the most active ones in the ROS robotics domain.
Hardware Acceleration Working Group during 2021 and 2022 suggests that there’s an increasingly evident interest in the use of hardware acceleration solutions in robotics and 2022 suggests that there’s an increasingly evident interest in the use of hardware acceleration solutions in robotics, however, the community survey conducted hints that only about half of the respondents (51%, section 3 .1) is confident about the value and differences between hardware (section 3.2) have ever programmed an acceleration kernel, the majority of which used NVIDIA CUDA ( 80.3%, section 3.4). This suggests that there’s still a lot of work to be done from silicon vendors’ side to further simplify the use and integration of their solutions in the ROS robotics ecosystem and provide comprehensive documentation. The previous statement is confirmed by section 3.3 which highlights what aspects of hardware acceleration are of most relevance to roboticists using ROS. Unsurprisingly , we find that more than half of the respondents ( 52. 1%) indicate that a simpler integration with ROS 2 and its ecosystem of tools is of most relevance to them: tools 19.8% and acceleration firmware 20.8%) 32.3% - Capabilities to easily switch between hardware accelerated and CPU-centric Nodes 11.5% - Benchmarking capabilities for hardware acceleration 4. 1% - Others12 See https: // github.

55 Hardware Acceleration Report in Robotics2022 When looking at which packages or components of ROS 2 and Gazebo roboticists would like to accelerate first (section 3.5, multiple selections allowed), we find that demanded group of packages to be accelerated. This is closely followed by “Gazebo physics engines’’ ( 60.4%), navigation2 ( 40.6%), “DDS communication middleware” These numbers are also confirmed by individual answers provided in sections 3.6 and 3 . 7.
The majority of the respondents (92.7%) indicated that they’d prefer the commercially friendly Apache 2.0 license for hardware acceleration resources and libraries (section 3.8). When asked about the format of acceleration kernels, opposed to 18.9% which would be fine with just binaries, 74.8% would prefer source code access to acceleration kernels with code examples (section 3.9).
One surprising aspect encountered while conducting the survey is that roboticists seem to care about speed or latency ( 48.9%, shorter execution time) as much as real-time and determinism ( 46.8%). Only a reduced 4.3% would prioritize power consumption as indicated in section 3. 10. This is somewhat counter-intuitive when looking at how the majority of the roboticists currently use GPUs (69.8%, section 3. 11) versus FPGAs (21.9%), since after all, it’s widely accepted that FPGAs outperform GPUs and CPUs while delivering real-time and determinism in computations, and with lower power consumption. T o add to this conflict, section 3. 14 hints that hardware acceleration is mostly used to create battery-powered robots (and thereby power-sensitive) with roboticists creating autonomous mobile robots (AMRs, 36.4%) followed by drones ( 19.8%), industrial robotic arms ( 12.5%) and legged robots ( 5.2%).
This indicates that there’s margin for FPGA usage growth in the ROS robotics community.
The numbers of type of accelerator usage (section 3. 11) are coherent with the most popular commercial solutions (section 3. 13) with NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier being the leading solution (33.3%) followed by both the NVIDIA Jetson Nano ( 15.6%) and the AMD’s Zynq UltraScale embedded portfolio ( 15.6%, including Kria® boards).
Roboticists seem to care about speed or latency ( 48.9%, shorter execution time) as much as real-time and determinism ( 46.8%) Finally , Ubuntu seems to be the dominant (79.5%, section 3. 15) operating system requested by ROS roboticists for hardware acceleration. Ubuntu 20.04 is the preferred option ( 59%) versus Ubuntu 22.04 (20.5%). Y octo- based rootfs are the second most popular choice with 7 .7% of the respondents preferring it. As for packaging mechanisms, .deb files are the preferred option ( 59%, section 3. 16) followed by Docker containers (23. 1%).There’s still a lot of work to be done from silicon vendors’ side to further simplify the use and integration of their solutions in the ROS robotics ecosystem 56The results obtained across benchmarks performed on a simple pre- (time between the start and the completion of a task) show that optimized FPGA accelerators outperform their GPU counterparts, even when using powerful GPUs. Considering mean runtime measurements (in ms, Figure 15, section 4.2), the use of CPU + FPGA13 deliver a 3.56x speedup over a comparable CPU + GPU14, and a 1.36x speedup over a comparable CPU15.
When considering a more powerful CPU + GPU16 combination (Figure 17 , section 4.2), the FPGA still outperforms it with a 1.59x speedup.
T o further study these results and to discriminate between any possible differences between the two CPUs used (A53 cores in KR260 and the A57 passing infrastructure overhead and reports on the perception computations in the graph. Results show how perception computations in the FPGA have a 4.27x speedup relative to their GPU counterparts when running in the Jetson Nano.
Latency results obtained across benchmarks performed on show that optimized FPGA accelerators outperform their GPU counterparts, even when using powerful GPUs Performance improvements in the form of latency with dedicated acceleration kernels in FPGAs are further evident when considering the power domain.

2.5 2 1.5 1 0.5 0 CPU + FPGA (KR260) CPU + FPGA ( Jetson Nano)CPU + GPU 57 Hardware Acceleration perception graph, we observe that the FPGA designs are much more power efficient than their GPU counterparts. The KR260 presents a performance-per- watt figure that's 6x ( 5.93x) better than the one in the Jetson Nano and 8x (7 .95x) better than the one in the Jetson AGX Xavier. An interesting observation can be made here comparing the performance-per-watt results obtained from the Jetson Nano and the Jetson AGX Xavier: the Xavier features a more powerful CPU and GPU, which consumes more energy while performing computations, however the latency performance of these computations do not scale in the same manner as the energy consumption. What these results hint is that the rate at which the energy consumption grows with NVIDIA Jetson (CPU + GPU) solutions seems to be smaller than the rate at which the latency performance improves, which leads to a decaying performance- statement links back to the rule of thumb shared in section 2.3 that emphasized how “bandwidth grows by at least the square of the improvement in latency” .
With GPUs often focusing on bandwidth to measure performance, when considering latency as the measure of performance GPUs struggle to find themselves on equal footing with their FPGA counterparts.
The rate at which the energy consumption grows with NVIDIA Jetson (CPU + GPU) solutions seems to be smaller than the rate at which the latency performance improves, which leads to a decaying performance- per-watt in our measurementsThere are nevertheless various advantages that GPUs inherently have and that should be considered while building complex robotic computations. Moreover, though FPGA kernel runtime execution outperforms their GPU counterparts, it’s relevant to note that FPGAs are resource-limited and thereby it’s important to consider that only a fixed set of accelerators would be able to fit within an FPGA at any given point in time whereas the GPUs don’t have this limitation due to their architectures.
Section 4.3 further dives into this and focuses on studying while estimating resources required in an FPGA. T o do so, it isolates perception computations by discarding both as well as the host-device (GPU or FPGA) data transfer overhead. Results depicted over figures 18-33 indicate that those running in a GPU by relevant speedups. All the way up to 500x (Figure 22) in popular perception algorithms running in an FPGA outperform those running in a GPU by relevant speedups. All the way up to 500x in popular perception algorithms such as the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) 58 Hardware Acceleration Report in Robotics2022 59 Hardware Acceleration solutions for the robotics architect Acceleration Robotics is amongst the top experts globally on the Robot Operating System (ROS), hardware acceleration efforts are accelerator-agnostic (FPGAs or GPUs) and robot-agnostic.

Other products ROBOTCORE Speed up your ROS robotics perception pipelines is an optimized robotic perception stack that leverages hardware acceleration to provide a speedup in your perception computations.
, delivers high performance, real-time and reliability to your robots' perception.
Accelerated robotics perception Data obtained in a robot from its sensors like cameras and lidar is typically fed into the perception the static and dynamic objects, and build a reliable and detailed representation of the robot's environment using computer vision and machine learning techniques. The perception layer in a robot is thereby responsible for object detection, segmentation and tracking . Traditionally, a perception pipeline starts with image pre-processing, followed by a region of interest detector and then a classifier that outputs detected objects.
is a hardware accelerated perception stack served as either source code or IP that allows your perception pipelines to reduce their runtime latency and increase throughput. Delivering a perception speedup , it's API-compatible with simplifying its integration in existing robots, so that you don't spend time reinventing the wheel and re-developing what already works.
Benchmarks Default ROS perception 0.7 Hz/image for a 3-Node perception pipeline in embedded A simple Rectify-Resize-Harris ROS perception pipeline is demonstrated which performs pre-processing ( Rectify and Resize ) and region of interest detection ( Harris corners detector). This simple pipeline consisting of only 3 ROS Nodes takes on average 1266.32 milliseconds to execute for a single pass, which leads to less than 1 Hz when running in an idle embedded Quad-core arm Cortex-A53.
ROBOTCORE 4.5x speedup in simple ROS perception pipelines Faster robots require faster perception.
delivers exactly this upgrading perception pipelines with a 4.5x speedup, impacting pipeline runtime and throughput in embedded. More complex perception graphs can further leverage acceleration, achieving 10x speedups and above.
Towards more capable robots Moving faster (or with more dexterity) requires faster perception computations. Edge perception is key to navigate under environments that change, which are most in the human world. The robot below is generating information from its sensors which needs to be processed at the edge (directly in the robot) for smooth behaviors, reducing any latency from the sensors and all the way into the actuators. By leveraging hardware acceleration, robots’ perception extracts information from these sensor readings which is then used to plan actions in the order of tenths of milliseconds. All happening on the edge and responding to environmental changes.
delivers faster perception capabilities to ROS computational graphs. So that your robots can move faster and better.

Other products ROBOTCORE FPGA and GPU hardware acceleration framework for ROS helps build custom compute architectures for robots , or IP cores , directly from ROS workspaces without complex third-party tool integrations. Make your robots faster, more deterministic and/or power-efficient. Simply put, it provides a vendor-agnostic development, build and deployment experience for creating robot hardware and hardware accelerators similar to the standard, non-accelerated ROS development flow.
Read the paper How does it work?
Traditional software development in robotics is about building dataflows with ROS computational graphs. These dataflows go from sensors to compute technologies, all the way down to actuators and back, representing the "brain" of the robot. Generally, ROS computational graphs are built in the CPUs of a given robot. But CPUs have fixed hardware, with pre-defined memory architectures and constraints which limit the performance. Sparked by the decline of Moore's Law and Dennard Scaling, specialized computing units capable of hardware acceleration have proven to be the answer for achieving higher performance in robotics.
allows to easily leverage FPGA and GPU hardware acceleration in a ROS-centric manner and build custom compute architectures for robots, or " IP cores ".
With these IP cores, roboticists can adapt one or simultaneously more of the properties of their computational graphs (e.g., its speed, determinism, power consumption) optimizing the amount of hardware resources and, as a consequence, the performance in an accelerated dataflow .

Accelerating industrial legacy robot manipulation TEKNIA, an auto parts manufacturer, wanted to speed up their existing robots for faster production cycles. We collaborated to achieve first a 16.21% increase in robot movement speed by introducing variations of the robot trajectories, velocities and accelerations, and later, on a second stage a 10.78% decrease in cycle time via double-manipulation. Leveraging modern techniques, we pushed the boundaries of the robot's velocity and acceleration with optimized machine-robot interactions and movements (paths and speed), ensuring efficient movement paths with minimal wasted motions. These improvements empowered TEKNIA to produce an additional 800 units per day and over 20,000 units per month.
The challenge Metallic tubes are manufactured in a continuous process, while going through various stages of production. A robot is used to manipulate the tubes and move them from one stage to another. The robot's speed and acceleration are limiting factors in the production cycle.

We considered the various possibilities, involving the various involved machines, a faster-moving robot, and also multiple robots. We then used this model to determine the optimal combination of the interactions between the robots and the connected machines in the automation line.
Modeling the time-series We modeled the time-series of the robot movements and the machine interactions to optimize the cycle time of the automation line. This allowed us to determine the optimal combination of the interactions between the robots and the connected machines in the automation line.
Digital twin-driven validation We used digital twins to co-develop and validate the optimal time-series model. This allowed us to simulate the robot movements and the machine interactions in a virtual environment, ensuring the optimal cycle time of the automation line.
Reducing the reality gap in digital twins We reduced the reality gap in the digital twin which allowed us for faster iterations between the real world and the digital twin. This enabled us to optimize the robot movement speed for real-world performance.

Result 1: 16.21% faster robot movement On a first iteration, we achieved a 16.21% increase in robot movement speed by means of modifying trajectories and movements (velocities and accelerations), enabling TEKNIA to speed up their production cycles and increase their manufacturing capacity.
Your browser does not support the video tag.
Result 2: 10.78% faster with dual manipulation We were further challenged to increase the productivity, so we proposed a dual manipulation system. This system allowed for synchronous multi-robot trajectory coordination leading to a 10.78% increase in the manufacturing cycle time.

RobotPerf | Reference benchmarking suite used to evaluate robotics computing performance Products Collaborative Benchmarks Consulting Robot IP design Company Case studies ROS News Do you like cookies?
We use cookies to ensure you get the best experience on our website.
RobotPerf Benchmarks The benchmarking suite to evaluate robotics computing performance RobotPerf™ provides an open reference benchmarking suite that is used to evaluate robotics , so that robotic architects can make informed decisions about the hardware and software components of their robotic systems.
RobotPerf™ source code RobotPerf™ reports Robot computations can improve when the right computing platform is selected Benchmarking is the act of running a computer program with a known workload to assess the program's relative performance. Performance information can help roboticists design more efficient robotic systems and select the right hardware for their robotic application.
The performance benchmarking suite in robotics The myriad combinations of robot hardware and robotics software make assessing robotic-system performance challenging, specially in an architecture-neutral, representative, and reproducible manner.
RobotPerf™ addresses this issue delivering a reference performance benchmarking suite that is used to evaluate robotics computing performance across CPU, GPU, FPGA and other compute accelerators. The benchmarks are designed to be representative of the performance of a robotic system and to be reproducible across different robotic systems. For that, , the de facto standard for robot application development.
Mission Represented by consortium of robotics leaders from industry, academia and research labs, RobotPerf™ is formated as an open project whose mission is to build open, fair and useful robotics benchmarks that are technology agnostic, vendor-neutral and provide unbiased evaluations of robotics computing performance for hardware, software, and services.
Purpose Benchmarking assists in performance evaluation. Roboticists can use performance data to develop more efficient robotic systems and choose the appropriate hardware for each robotic application with the help of performance data. It can also aid in comprehending the trade-offs between algorithms implementing the same skill.
Standards RobotPerf™ aligns to robotics standards so that you don’t spend time reinventing the wheel and re-develop what already works for most. Particularly benchmarks are conducted using the as its common baseline. RobotPerf™ also aligns to standardization initiatives within the ROS ecosystem related to computing performance and benchmarking such as REP 2008 ( ). See the RobotPerf™ Specification for more details.
RobotPerf™ source code Why?
Robot behaviors take the form of computational graphs, with data flowing between computation Nodes, across physical networks (communication buses) and while mapping to underlying sensors and actuators. The popular choice to build these computational graphs for robots these days is the Robot Operating System (ROS), a framework for robot application development. ROS enables you to build computational graphs and create robot behaviors by providing libraries, a communication infrastructure, drivers and tools to put it all together. Most companies building real robots today use ROS or similar event-driven software frameworks. ROS is thereby the common language in robotics, with several hundreds of companies and thousands of developers ROS and solves many of the problems in building reliable robotics systems.
vendor solutions support, and with a variety of modular packages, each implementing a different robotics feature that simplifies performance benchmarking in robotics.

More about ROS Robotics Computing Performance: Visualizing For robotic architects, delving into the multifaceted dimensions of computing performance is crucial, yet often intricate. RobotPerf™ stands as a beacon in this space, offering a range of visualizations tailored for clarity and depth. One such illustration is the polar plot, which displays benchmarks within a particular robotic computing category on separate axes. Through RobotPerf™, architects can instantly perceive a system's proficiency across these benchmarks.
They can pinpoint both the strengths and areas of improvement, and thereby make informed decisions in design and optimization. With RobotPerf™, the complexity of robotics computing performance is transformed into actionable insights, making the architect's role not only simpler but also more effective.
Robot Benchmarks : Two benchmarking approaches GREY-BOX is an application-specific measure capable of watching internal states of the system that can measure (probe) certain points in the system, thus generate the measurement data with minimal interference incurring into a minimal average latency of only 3.3 us, making it well-suited for real-time systems. This approach is more complex, but it offers a more detailed analysis, and makes it more appealing for real-world robotic applications and real-time systems, but a less good choice for quick prototyping.
BLACK-BOX measures performance by eliminating the layers above the layer-of-interest and replacing those with a specific test application or compute node. While this approach doesn't need extra instrumentation, and is easier to implement, it offers a less detailed analysis, has limited data points, and uses a non-standard data format while altering the computational graph (introducing new nodes). This makes it less appealing for real-world robotic applications and real-time systems, but a good choice for quick prototyping.

Benchmarks Launch your ROS graphs into the cloud Supporting the top cloud service providers Hardware acceleration in the cloud for ROS Leveraging the cloud provides roboticists with unlimited resources to further accelerate computations. Besides lots of CPU, cloud computing providers such as GCP, Azure or AWS offer instances that provide big FPGAs and GPUs for on-cloud hardware acceleration. This means once the ROS graph is partially in the cloud, architects can use custom accelerators to reduce and optimize robotic computations. But tapping into all that power while aligned with common ROS and robotics development flows is non-trivial.

We use cookies to ensure you get the best experience on our website.
Accelerating metal part manufacturing with robots Heavy metallic parts are manipulated by machinery and robots with tasks involving soldering and assembly. The environment is characterized by large robots and slow-communicating large machinery and equipment, with workers overseeing the slow process. In our work with Grupo Celsa we accelerated their robotic vision pipelines by more than 62x , down to milliseconds, enabling faster robot manipulation and real-time quality control.
The challenge The traditional process of soldering and assembling heavy metallic parts is slow and labor-intensive. These parts often have unstructured surfaces, requiring robots to rely on advanced perception systems powered by computer vision for precise manipulation. The challenge lies in speeding up these perception systems to enhance robotic efficiency and enable real-time quality control.

Robot Operating System (ROS) | Acceleration Robotics Products Collaborative Benchmarks Consulting Robot IP design Company Case studies ROS News Do you like cookies?
We use cookies to ensure you get the best experience on our website.
Robot Operating System (ROS) The de facto framework for robot application development ROS is the common language roboticists use to build robots. It's an open source and modular set of software libraries and tools that help you build robot applications. It provides a message-passing system between software components, drivers for robot hardware, state-of-the-art robotic algorithms, and powerful developer tools to test, debug and visualize your robot.
Why is ROS so important?
Robots are networks of networks, with sensors capturing data, passing to compute technologies, and then on to actuators and back again in a deterministic manner. These networks can be understood as the nervous system of the robot, passing across compute Nodes , that represent neurons . Like the human nervous systems, real-time information across all these computational Nodes is fundamental for the robot to behave coherently.
"Robot brains" are built with this same philosophy. Behaviors take the form of computational graphs, with data flowing between Nodes, across physical networks (communication buses) and while mapping to underlying sensors, compute technologies and actuators.
ROS enables you to build these computational graphs and create robot behaviors by providing libraries, a communication infrastructure, drivers and tools to put it all together.
"Nearly 55% of total commercial robots shipped in 2024 will have at least one ROS package installed, creating a large installed base of ROS-enabled robots."

Designed for production reliability are based on requirements from industry stakeholders.
Multi-platform deployment of on-robot autonomy, back-end management, and user interfaces. The tiered support model allows for ports to new platforms, such as real-time and embedded OSs.
Multi-domain to outdoor, home to automotive, underwater to space, and consumer to industrial.
No vendor-links publish-subscribe semantics. Below, there are multiple implementations of the communications code.
Above, core libraries and user applications are portable.

Other products ROBOTCORE Speed up your ROS tf ) is an optimized robotics transform library that manages efficiently the transformations between coordinate systems in a robot.
tf2 ) library , ROBOTCORE delivers higher throughput and lower latency while aligning with the standard way to keep track of coordinate frames and transform data within a ROS robotic system.
Robotics consulting?
Accelerated coordinate transformations ( tf ) The ROS tf2 library manages the transformations between coordinate systems in a robot. It does so by using a directed single rooted tree that has methods for 1) registration of transformation information and 2) computation of coordinate transformations. The cool thing about tf2 is that it allows to transform data in time as well as in space, which makes it a centric component in the ROS ecosystem being used in popular robotics stacks including navigation2 , moveit2 and Autoware.Auto .
ROBOTCORE introduces architectural upgrades in the tf2 implementation and leverages hardware acceleration to create customized transform data pipelines that deliver higher throughput and lower the latency while reading (or publishing) the tf2 tree. ROBOTCORE is served either as source code or as an IP which allows your ROS computational graphs to easily integrate it. Delivering lower latency and higher throughput , it's API-compatible with tf2 library simplifying its integration in existing robots, so that you don’t spend time reinventing the wheel and re-developing what already works.
Benchmarks Why tf2 ?
To keep track of a robot's position, and the rest of the world in relation to itself tf2 allows roboticists to keep track of multiple coordinate frames over time. It maintains the relationship between coordinate frames in a graph-like data structure (a tree) that is buffered in time, and lets the ROS graph-users to transform data between any two coordinate frames at any desired point in time, provided such point is available within the buffers.
tf2 is generally best understood via example: consider a robot fleet consisting on 3 robots in a warehouse that start from similar positions. Each robot senses the environment using the laser mounted on its top ( base_link_laser frame), as well as the lasers readings from the other robots. The challenge on each robot to integrate all these laser readings requires knowledge of the relationship over time and over space between the laser ( base_link_laser frame), to the base ( base_link frame), to the ground level ( base_footprint frame), to the world frame ( map frame) and back to whichever frame ends up being used to compute the sensor fusion. After all, sensor readings can only be integrated when expressed in the same coordinate frame.
Up to 5x faster tf2 tree operations tf2 sits at the core of navigation2 , moveit2 and Autoware.Auto (among others). For every motion computation, the tf2 tree gets accessed many times. This makes tf2 a very time-sensitive component in high performance robots, wherein both latency and throughput must be carefully considered.
That's where ROBOTCORE comes to play. It introduces architectural upgrades in the tf2 implementation and leverages hardware acceleration delivering a 5x latency speedup in coordinate transformations.
Developer-ready documentation and support is served by seasoned ROS developers and for ROS development.
It ships as a complement to ROBOTCORE either as IP, or as source code. It includes documentation, examples, reference designs and the possibility of various levels of support.

This system ensures lower and consistent communication latency, crucial for real-time robotic applications, and addresses major bottlenecks in robotic communications [1] , [2] , [3] .

Multiple Cameras for Extended Coverage.
Occlusion Handling If the Occlusion Handling (OH) variant of the control system is enabled, a Depth Grid Map is generated in the form of a file that can live either in the CPU or in the FPGA memory. The Depth Grid Map contains the mapping from one camera, the principal camera, and the other cameras introduced in the system, the secondary cameras. The principal camera's view volume is divided into a grid by dividing it into pixels (in x and y) and by a user-defined depth value in the z-axis, generating a 2.5D frustum. Each cell contains data on the pixel region and depth in which they are visible in other cameras. This mapping is then used to query the different images during the distance evaluation stage. As a result, the system can handle occlusions across cameras and provide a more accurate representation of the robot's environment, enhancing its safety and reliability while delivering the evasive behaviors required for safe human-robot collaboration.
The Control Theory Behind Depth Image-Based Robot Control Our system captures depth images of the robot and its surroundings, requiring calibration of the relative positions between the robot and the camera. The robot's geometry is filtered out, and critical distances from control points on the robot to the surrounding depth camera detections are identified.
Control points are defined using TF frames on the robot's geometry, typically on the axes connecting the joints. These points can be added by including link elements without geometry to the robot's URDF/XACRO model . The distribution of these points should ensure the entire robot is covered within the repulsive potential field's saturation region . The distance between consecutive points should generally be less than \(\left(\frac{-3}{\alpha} + 1\right) \frac{\rho}{2}\). More points increase precision but also computation time.
Based on these distances, a Cartesian repulsive vector and an attractive configuration (PID) vector are computed. These vectors are combined in joint space to obtain a velocity command . The repulsion intensity (\(v_{\text{rep}}\)) is regulated by a curve defined by \(v_{\text{max}}\), \(\rho\), \(d_{\text{min}}\), and \(\alpha\).
This velocity command is limited based on joint velocity limits from other control points and smoothed through an acceleration filter before being transmitted to the robot.
The operation of this system is as follows: A stream of depth images is captured, showing the target robot and its immediate surroundings. The relative positions between the robot and the camera must be calibrated.
The robot's geometry is filtered out from these images.
The filtered image is analyzed to identify critical distances from control points defined on the robot's geometry to the detections from the surrounding depth camera. An example of these control points for a UR10e robot can be seen in the following image. These control points are defined using TF frames located on the robot's geometry, typically on the axes connecting the joints. These points can be simply defined by adding a series of `link` elements without associated geometry to the robot's URDF/XACRO model. The process of adding/modifying these control points to the configuration of the various involved nodes and the controller will be reflected in the documentation provided with the solution code. The distribution of these points along the robot's geometry should generally be sufficient to ensure that the entire volume of the robot is covered within the saturation region of the repulsive potential field function. This function appears in the next step, but as a rule of thumb, the distance between consecutive points should generally be less than \(\left(\frac{-3}{\alpha} + 1\right) \frac{\rho}{2}\). It is worth noting that the greater the number and density of these points, the more precise the coverage of the geometry at the cost of increased computation time.
Based on these distances for the end effector control point, a Cartesian repulsive vector is computed, and based on the current goal, an attractive configuration (PID) vector is also computed. These vectors are combined in joint space to obtain a velocity command. The intensity of the repulsion (\(v_{\text{rep}}\)) is regulated by a curve defined by the attached image: Where \(v_{\text{max}}\) is the maximum Cartesian repulsion velocity, \(\rho\) is the radius around a control point where obstacles are considered, \(d_{\text{min}}\) is the minimum distance from the control point to the obstacle, and \(\alpha\) is a shape factor that regulates the slope of the curve.
This velocity command is then limited based on velocity limits for each joint computed from the other control points.
The joint command limited to these new limits is smoothed through an acceleration filter.
This smoothed command is transmitted to the robot.

Meeting time deadlines in their computations (real-time) is the most important feature however other characteristics are also of relevance while designing robotic computations including the time between the start and the completion of a task (latency), the total amount of work done in a given time (bandwidth or throughput) or that a task happens in exactly the same timeframe, each time (determinism). CPUs are widely used in robotics due to their availability however they hardly provide real-time and safety guarantees while delivering high throughput. Hardware acceleration ( with either FPGAs, GPUs or other accelerators) presents an answer to this problem. One that allows the robotics architect to create custom computing architectures for robots that comply with real-time and bandwidth requirements, while lowering power consumption.
Hardware acceleration has the potential to revolutionize robotics, enabling new applications by speeding up robot response times while remaining power-efficient. However, the diversity of acceleration options makes it difficult for roboticists to select the right computational resource for each task. This report captures the state-of-the art of hardware acceleration in robotics by following a quantitative approach and presents robotic architects with a resource to consider while designing their robot computational architectures. The report compares the most popular computation solutions in robotics used today through reproducible and Acceleration Working Group GitHub organization.
Since most companies building real robots today use ROS or similar event-driven software frameworks, this report uses ROS as the common baseline in robotics to conduct the study (section 2.2). In particular, we framework for robot application development and consider both bandwidth and latency to benchmark performance in robotics (section 2.3) using a grey-box and non-functional benchmarking approach (section 2.4).
9 Hardware Acceleration Report in Robotics2022 The work presented in this report happened in two phases. First, a community survey conducted in both the ROS and the overall robotics communities helped grasp the interest behind the use of hardware acceleration in robotics.
Input from this community survey was then used to drive the second phase, a hardware acceleration benchmarking effort. The most relevant results from these two phases are summarized below: Community Survey Only about half of the respondents (51%, section 3 .1 ) is confident about the value and differences between hardware acceleration solutions for robotics: Only 62.5% (section 3.2) have ever programmed an acceleration kernel.
This suggests that there’s still a lot of work to be done from silicon vendors’ side to further simplify the use and integration of their solutions.
The majority of the roboticists currently use GPUs (69.8%, section 3. 11) versus FPGAs (21.9%): Roboticists seem to care about speed or latency (48.9%, shorter execution time) as much as real-time and determinism (46.8%). Only a reduced 4.3% would prioritize power consumption (section 3. 10).
This indicates that there’s margin for FPGA usage growth in the ROS robotics community .
When asked about the most relevant aspects of hardware acceleration (section 3.3), 52. 1% of the roboticists that and its ecosystem of tools is of most relevance to them: 11.5%, colcon build tools 19.8% and acceleration firmware 20.8%).

74.8% would prefer source code access to acceleration kernels with code examples (section 3.9) Ubuntu seems to be the dominant (79.5%, section 3. 15) operating system requested by ROS roboticists for hardware acceleration.
Ubuntu 20.04 is the preferred option (59%) followed by Ubuntu 22.04 (20.5%).
Y octo-based rootfs is preferred after Ubuntu (7. 7 % ).
For packaging accelerators, deb files are the preferred option (59%, section 3. 16) followed by Docker containers (23. 1%).
10Results obtained across benchmarks performed on a of view optimized FPGA accelerators outperform their GPU counterparts, even when using powerful GPUs.
Considering mean runtime measurements (in ms, Figure 15, section 4.2), the use of a CPU + FPGA combination delivers a 3.56x speedup over a comparable CPU + GPU, and a 1.36x speedup over a comparable CPU.
When considering a more powerful CPU + GPU combination (Figure 17 , section 4.2), the FPGA still outperforms it with a 1.59x speedup.
outperform those running in a GPU by relevant speedups.
T o discriminate between any possible differences between the CPU cores, measurements were collected isolating perception computations by infrastructure overhead, as well as the host-device (GPU or FPGA) data transfer overhead.
Popular perception algorithms such as the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) show a 500x speedup in an FPGA and relative to a comparable GPU (Figure 22).Benchmarking hardware acceleration 11 Hardware Acceleration Report in Robotics2022 11Figure 0 Performance-per- watt benchmark perception graph across various accelerators. The computational graph studied is described in section 4.2.
2.5 2 1.5 1 0.5 0 CPU + FPGA (KR260) CPU + FPGA ( Jetson Nano)CPU + GPU ( Jetson AGX Xavier) Overall, results hint that the rate at which the energy consumption grows with GPU solutions seems to be smaller than the rate at which the latency performance improves, which leads to a decaying performance-per- GPU + CPU solutions. Instead, FPGA-enabled solutions present a performance-per-watt figure that’s 6x ( 5.93x) better than the one observed in comparable GPU + CPU sets and 8x (7 .95x) better than the one in more power GPU + CPU sets.
These results indicate that using bandwidth as the only measure of performance can be misleading in ROS and robotics. Moreover, data suggests that when considering latency as the measure of performance, GPU sets may struggle to find themselves on equal footing with their FPGA counterparts.
There are nevertheless various advantages that GPUs inherently have and that should be considered while building complex robotic computations. Moreover, though FPGA kernel runtime execution outperforms their GPU counterparts, it’s relevant to note that FPGAs are resource-limited and thereby it’s important to consider that only a fixed set of accelerators would be able to fit within an FPGA at any given point in time whereas the GPUs don’t have this limitation due to their architectures.
Scalable robot compute architectures that consider hardware acceleration should look at combining CPUs, GPUs and FPGAs to obtain the best trade-off.
12 Hardware Acceleration Report in Robotics2022 13 Introduction 14The CPU whack-a-mole in robotics Robots are deterministic machines. Meeting time deadlines in their computations (real-time) is the most important feature however other characteristics are also of relevance while designing robotic computations including the time between the start and the completion of a task (latency), the total amount of work done in a given time (bandwidth or throughput) or that a task happens in exactly the same timeframe, each time (determinism).
There’s a critical relationship between the hardware and the software capabilities in a robot. Robotic systems usually have limited on-board resources, including memory , I/O, disk or compute capabilities, making it hard to balance between real-time and bandwidth requirements ( due to limited shared resources), and restricting robots’ reaction capabilities and speed. A key challenge in robotics using general purpose CPUs1 is that they hardly provide real-time and safety guarantees while delivering high throughput. The de facto strategy in industry [1 ] to meet timing deadlines is a laborious, empirical, and case-by-case tuning of the system. This “CPU whack-a-mole” approach in robotics is unsustainable and hard to scale due to the lack of a hardware-supported timing-safe event driven programming interface in CPUs.CPUs hardly provide real-time and safety guarantees while delivering high throughput.
This “CPU whack- a-mole” approach in robotics is unsustainable and hard to scale1 CPUs are widely used in commercial compute platforms in robotics due to their availability and generalized use. The general purpose nature of CPUs makes them specially interesting for roboticists to kickstart projects, however this comes at a cost when translating into real applications: their fixed architectures and limited amount of resources difficult adaptability to new ( computing) robotic scenarios and always impose a trade-off between performance and determinism.2 .1 15 Hardware Acceleration Report in Robotics2022 Hardware acceleration with dedicated compute architectures (in either FPGAs, GPUs or other accelerators) is presented as an alternative to CPUs.
One that allows the architect to adaptively generate custom computing architectures to meet the robotic computing demands, delivering a solution that can comply with real-time and bandwidth requirements while increasing reliability and lowering power consumption. Hardware acceleration is presented as an alternative to CPUs delivering a solution that can comply with real-time and bandwidth requirementsThis report presents robotic architects with a resource to consider while designing their robot computational architectures that describes how hardware acceleration can improve their performance. T o study the capabilities of hardware acceleration in robotics, this article follows a quantitative approach [2] to measure performance and compares the most popular hardware Results presented in this report are meant to be reproducible and disclosed as open source examples Acceleration Working Group GitHub organization repositories.
baseline in robotics Robot behaviors take the form of computational graphs, with data flowing between computation Nodes, across physical networks ( communication buses) and while mapping to underlying sensors and actuators. The popular choice to build these computational graphs for robots these days is the Robot Operating System (ROS) [3], a framework for robot application development. ROS enables you to build computational graphs and create robot behaviors by providing libraries, a communication infrastructure, drivers and tools to put it all together. Most companies building real robots today use ROS or similar event-driven software frameworks. ROS is thereby the common language in robotics, with several hundreds of companies and thousands of developers using it to address some of the challenges in ROS and solves many of the problems in building reliable robotics systems.
robot application development most silicon vendor solutions support, and with a variety of modular packages, each implementing a different robotics feature that simplifies performance benchmarking in robotics.2.2 17 Hardware Acceleration Report in Robotics2022 Bandwidth, latency and performance considerations The field of robotics is changing rapidly and must be studied with real examples and measurements on real robotic computations, rather than simply as a collection of definitions, designs and marketing actions. The quantitative approach [2] to robotics systems architecture fits well in this context and helps robotic architects come up with better performing architectures through an empirical strategy , and case-by-case tuning of the system.
In robotics bandwidth or throughput is the total amount of work done in a given time, such as the publication feed resulting from processing the data of a camera, or the second) of a processed point cloud coming from a depth sensor. In contrast, latency or response time is the time between the start and the completion of a task, such as T opic subscription in a computational graph.
When speaking about performance in robotics, both bandwidth and latency should be taken into consideration. In particular, given the importance of real- time in robotics we’ d generally be interested in the latency for performance benchmarking. 2.3 A final consideration is the bandwidth/latency performance improvement ratio in robotics. A simple rule of thumb in ( general) computation is that bandwidth grows by at least the square of the improvement in latency. Robotic architects should take this into consideration while designing their robotic systems.When speaking about performance in robotics, both bandwidth and latency should be taken in consideration 18Methodology for benchmarking performance Benchmarking is the act of running a computer program to assess its relative performance. In the context of hardware acceleration, it’s fundamental to assess the relative performance of an acceleration kernel versus its CPU scalar computing baseline. Similarly , benchmarking helps comparing acceleration kernels across hardware acceleration technology solutions ( e.g. FPGA_A vs FPGA_B or FPGA_A vs GPU_A, etc.) and across kernel implementations ( within the same hardware acceleration technology solution).
There’re different types of benchmarking approaches. The following diagram depicts the most popular inspired by [5] : Figure 1 Performance benchmarking approaches.

2 and its computational graph. If necessary , they should instrument the communications middleware and its underlying layers.
Intra-process, inter-process and intra-network: Measures conducted should consider communication within a process in the same SoC, between processes in an SoC and between different SoCs connected in the same network (intra-network).
Compute substrate-agnostic: benchmarks should be able to run on different hardware acceleration technology solutions. For that purpose, a CPU-centric framework (as opposed to an acceleration technology-specific framework) that can be integrated in various accelerators for benchmarking and/or tracing is the ideal choice.
Automated: benchmarks and related source code should be designed with automation in mind. Once ready , creating a benchmark and producing results should be (ideally ) a fully automated process.
Hardware farm mindset: benchmarks will be conducted on hardware embedded platforms sitting in a farm-like environment (redundancy of tests, multiple SoCs/boards) with the intent of validating and comparing different technologies.
Accounting for all of this, and similar to the ROS Enhancement Proposal (REP) REP-2008 proposal [6 ] , in this report we adopt a grey-box and non-functional benchmarking approach for hardware acceleration that allows to evaluate the relative complete computational graphs. T o realize it in a technology agnostic-manner, we select the Linux T racing T oolkit next generation (L TT ng) which will be used for tracing and benchmarking.Differences between tracing and benchmarking T racing and benchmarking can be better understood as follows: T racing: a technique used to understand what goes on in a running software system.
Benchmarking: a method of comparing the performance of various systems by running a common test.
From these definitions, inherently one can determine that both benchmarking and tracing are connected in the sense that the test/benchmark will use a series of measurements for comparison.
These measurements will come from tracing probes. In other words, tracing will collect data that will then be fed into a benchmark program for comparison.2 .4.1 20 Hardware Acceleration Report in Robotics2022 21 Community Survey 22Are you familiar with the different hardware acceleration solutions and their advantages (e.g. FPGAs vs GPUs) 96 answers 46,9% 51%3.1 Figure 2 Results from the “Hardware acceleration in survey” (link) question: “ Are you familiar with the different hardware acceleration solutions and their advantages Gazebo?

38Robotics perception helps sense the static and dynamic objects, and build a reliable and detailed representation of the robot’s environment using computer vision and machine learning techniques. Data obtained in a robot from its sensors like cameras and LIDAR is typically fed into the perception layer turning into something useful for decision making and planning physical actions. The perception layer in a robot is thereby responsible for object detection, segmentation and tracking. T raditionally , a perception pipeline starts with image pre-processing, followed by a region of interest detector and then a classifier that outputs (Components more specifically ) that can be used to build perception pipelines easily .Case study: Hardware subsections will follow the methodology described in section 2.4.

With plenty of attendance in each one of its meetings12 and with the participation of multiple silicon vendors, the group is arguably one of the most active ones in the ROS robotics domain.
Hardware Acceleration Working Group during 2021 and 2022 suggests that there’s an increasingly evident interest in the use of hardware acceleration solutions in robotics and 2022 suggests that there’s an increasingly evident interest in the use of hardware acceleration solutions in robotics, however, the community survey conducted hints that only about half of the respondents (51%, section 3 .1) is confident about the value and differences between hardware (section 3.2) have ever programmed an acceleration kernel, the majority of which used NVIDIA CUDA ( 80.3%, section 3.4). This suggests that there’s still a lot of work to be done from silicon vendors’ side to further simplify the use and integration of their solutions in the ROS robotics ecosystem and provide comprehensive documentation. The previous statement is confirmed by section 3.3 which highlights what aspects of hardware acceleration are of most relevance to roboticists using ROS. Unsurprisingly , we find that more than half of the respondents ( 52. 1%) indicate that a simpler integration with ROS 2 and its ecosystem of tools is of most relevance to them: tools 19.8% and acceleration firmware 20.8%) 32.3% - Capabilities to easily switch between hardware accelerated and CPU-centric Nodes 11.5% - Benchmarking capabilities for hardware acceleration 4. 1% - Others12 See https: // github.

55 Hardware Acceleration Report in Robotics2022 When looking at which packages or components of ROS 2 and Gazebo roboticists would like to accelerate first (section 3.5, multiple selections allowed), we find that demanded group of packages to be accelerated. This is closely followed by “Gazebo physics engines’’ ( 60.4%), navigation2 ( 40.6%), “DDS communication middleware” These numbers are also confirmed by individual answers provided in sections 3.6 and 3 . 7.
The majority of the respondents (92.7%) indicated that they’d prefer the commercially friendly Apache 2.0 license for hardware acceleration resources and libraries (section 3.8). When asked about the format of acceleration kernels, opposed to 18.9% which would be fine with just binaries, 74.8% would prefer source code access to acceleration kernels with code examples (section 3.9).
One surprising aspect encountered while conducting the survey is that roboticists seem to care about speed or latency ( 48.9%, shorter execution time) as much as real-time and determinism ( 46.8%). Only a reduced 4.3% would prioritize power consumption as indicated in section 3. 10. This is somewhat counter-intuitive when looking at how the majority of the roboticists currently use GPUs (69.8%, section 3. 11) versus FPGAs (21.9%), since after all, it’s widely accepted that FPGAs outperform GPUs and CPUs while delivering real-time and determinism in computations, and with lower power consumption. T o add to this conflict, section 3. 14 hints that hardware acceleration is mostly used to create battery-powered robots (and thereby power-sensitive) with roboticists creating autonomous mobile robots (AMRs, 36.4%) followed by drones ( 19.8%), industrial robotic arms ( 12.5%) and legged robots ( 5.2%).
This indicates that there’s margin for FPGA usage growth in the ROS robotics community.
The numbers of type of accelerator usage (section 3. 11) are coherent with the most popular commercial solutions (section 3. 13) with NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier being the leading solution (33.3%) followed by both the NVIDIA Jetson Nano ( 15.6%) and the AMD’s Zynq UltraScale embedded portfolio ( 15.6%, including Kria® boards).
Roboticists seem to care about speed or latency ( 48.9%, shorter execution time) as much as real-time and determinism ( 46.8%) Finally , Ubuntu seems to be the dominant (79.5%, section 3. 15) operating system requested by ROS roboticists for hardware acceleration. Ubuntu 20.04 is the preferred option ( 59%) versus Ubuntu 22.04 (20.5%). Y octo- based rootfs are the second most popular choice with 7 .7% of the respondents preferring it. As for packaging mechanisms, .deb files are the preferred option ( 59%, section 3. 16) followed by Docker containers (23. 1%).There’s still a lot of work to be done from silicon vendors’ side to further simplify the use and integration of their solutions in the ROS robotics ecosystem 56The results obtained across benchmarks performed on a simple pre- (time between the start and the completion of a task) show that optimized FPGA accelerators outperform their GPU counterparts, even when using powerful GPUs. Considering mean runtime measurements (in ms, Figure 15, section 4.2), the use of CPU + FPGA13 deliver a 3.56x speedup over a comparable CPU + GPU14, and a 1.36x speedup over a comparable CPU15.
When considering a more powerful CPU + GPU16 combination (Figure 17 , section 4.2), the FPGA still outperforms it with a 1.59x speedup.
T o further study these results and to discriminate between any possible differences between the two CPUs used (A53 cores in KR260 and the A57 passing infrastructure overhead and reports on the perception computations in the graph. Results show how perception computations in the FPGA have a 4.27x speedup relative to their GPU counterparts when running in the Jetson Nano.
Latency results obtained across benchmarks performed on show that optimized FPGA accelerators outperform their GPU counterparts, even when using powerful GPUs Performance improvements in the form of latency with dedicated acceleration kernels in FPGAs are further evident when considering the power domain.

2.5 2 1.5 1 0.5 0 CPU + FPGA (KR260) CPU + FPGA ( Jetson Nano)CPU + GPU 57 Hardware Acceleration perception graph, we observe that the FPGA designs are much more power efficient than their GPU counterparts. The KR260 presents a performance-per- watt figure that's 6x ( 5.93x) better than the one in the Jetson Nano and 8x (7 .95x) better than the one in the Jetson AGX Xavier. An interesting observation can be made here comparing the performance-per-watt results obtained from the Jetson Nano and the Jetson AGX Xavier: the Xavier features a more powerful CPU and GPU, which consumes more energy while performing computations, however the latency performance of these computations do not scale in the same manner as the energy consumption. What these results hint is that the rate at which the energy consumption grows with NVIDIA Jetson (CPU + GPU) solutions seems to be smaller than the rate at which the latency performance improves, which leads to a decaying performance- statement links back to the rule of thumb shared in section 2.3 that emphasized how “bandwidth grows by at least the square of the improvement in latency” .
With GPUs often focusing on bandwidth to measure performance, when considering latency as the measure of performance GPUs struggle to find themselves on equal footing with their FPGA counterparts.
The rate at which the energy consumption grows with NVIDIA Jetson (CPU + GPU) solutions seems to be smaller than the rate at which the latency performance improves, which leads to a decaying performance- per-watt in our measurementsThere are nevertheless various advantages that GPUs inherently have and that should be considered while building complex robotic computations. Moreover, though FPGA kernel runtime execution outperforms their GPU counterparts, it’s relevant to note that FPGAs are resource-limited and thereby it’s important to consider that only a fixed set of accelerators would be able to fit within an FPGA at any given point in time whereas the GPUs don’t have this limitation due to their architectures.
Section 4.3 further dives into this and focuses on studying while estimating resources required in an FPGA. T o do so, it isolates perception computations by discarding both as well as the host-device (GPU or FPGA) data transfer overhead. Results depicted over figures 18-33 indicate that those running in a GPU by relevant speedups. All the way up to 500x (Figure 22) in popular perception algorithms running in an FPGA outperform those running in a GPU by relevant speedups. All the way up to 500x in popular perception algorithms such as the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) 58 Hardware Acceleration Report in Robotics2022 59 Hardware Acceleration solutions for the robotics architect Acceleration Robotics is amongst the top experts globally on the Robot Operating System (ROS), hardware acceleration efforts are accelerator-agnostic (FPGAs or GPUs) and robot-agnostic.

Accelerated robotics perception Data obtained in a robot from its sensors like cameras and lidar is typically fed into the perception the static and dynamic objects, and build a reliable and detailed representation of the robot's environment using computer vision and machine learning techniques. The perception layer in a robot is thereby responsible for object detection, segmentation and tracking . Traditionally, a perception pipeline starts with image pre-processing, followed by a region of interest detector and then a classifier that outputs detected objects.
is a hardware accelerated perception stack served as either source code or IP that allows your perception pipelines to reduce their runtime latency and increase throughput. Delivering a perception speedup , it's API-compatible with simplifying its integration in existing robots, so that you don't spend time reinventing the wheel and re-developing what already works.

This simple pipeline consisting of only 3 ROS Nodes takes on average 1266.32 milliseconds to execute for a single pass, which leads to less than 1 Hz when running in an idle embedded Quad-core arm Cortex-A53.
ROBOTCORE 4.5x speedup in simple ROS perception pipelines Faster robots require faster perception.
delivers exactly this upgrading perception pipelines with a 4.5x speedup, impacting pipeline runtime and throughput in embedded. More complex perception graphs can further leverage acceleration, achieving 10x speedups and above.
Towards more capable robots Moving faster (or with more dexterity) requires faster perception computations. Edge perception is key to navigate under environments that change, which are most in the human world. The robot below is generating information from its sensors which needs to be processed at the edge (directly in the robot) for smooth behaviors, reducing any latency from the sensors and all the way into the actuators. By leveraging hardware acceleration, robots’ perception extracts information from these sensor readings which is then used to plan actions in the order of tenths of milliseconds. All happening on the edge and responding to environmental changes.
delivers faster perception capabilities to ROS computational graphs. So that your robots can move faster and better.

Other products ROBOTCORE FPGA and GPU hardware acceleration framework for ROS helps build custom compute architectures for robots , or IP cores , directly from ROS workspaces without complex third-party tool integrations. Make your robots faster, more deterministic and/or power-efficient. Simply put, it provides a vendor-agnostic development, build and deployment experience for creating robot hardware and hardware accelerators similar to the standard, non-accelerated ROS development flow.
Read the paper How does it work?
Traditional software development in robotics is about building dataflows with ROS computational graphs. These dataflows go from sensors to compute technologies, all the way down to actuators and back, representing the "brain" of the robot. Generally, ROS computational graphs are built in the CPUs of a given robot. But CPUs have fixed hardware, with pre-defined memory architectures and constraints which limit the performance. Sparked by the decline of Moore's Law and Dennard Scaling, specialized computing units capable of hardware acceleration have proven to be the answer for achieving higher performance in robotics.
allows to easily leverage FPGA and GPU hardware acceleration in a ROS-centric manner and build custom compute architectures for robots, or " IP cores ".
With these IP cores, roboticists can adapt one or simultaneously more of the properties of their computational graphs (e.g., its speed, determinism, power consumption) optimizing the amount of hardware resources and, as a consequence, the performance in an accelerated dataflow .

Accelerating industrial legacy robot manipulation TEKNIA, an auto parts manufacturer, wanted to speed up their existing robots for faster production cycles. We collaborated to achieve first a 16.21% increase in robot movement speed by introducing variations of the robot trajectories, velocities and accelerations, and later, on a second stage a 10.78% decrease in cycle time via double-manipulation. Leveraging modern techniques, we pushed the boundaries of the robot's velocity and acceleration with optimized machine-robot interactions and movements (paths and speed), ensuring efficient movement paths with minimal wasted motions. These improvements empowered TEKNIA to produce an additional 800 units per day and over 20,000 units per month.
The challenge Metallic tubes are manufactured in a continuous process, while going through various stages of production. A robot is used to manipulate the tubes and move them from one stage to another. The robot's speed and acceleration are limiting factors in the production cycle.

We considered the various possibilities, involving the various involved machines, a faster-moving robot, and also multiple robots. We then used this model to determine the optimal combination of the interactions between the robots and the connected machines in the automation line.
Modeling the time-series We modeled the time-series of the robot movements and the machine interactions to optimize the cycle time of the automation line. This allowed us to determine the optimal combination of the interactions between the robots and the connected machines in the automation line.
Digital twin-driven validation We used digital twins to co-develop and validate the optimal time-series model. This allowed us to simulate the robot movements and the machine interactions in a virtual environment, ensuring the optimal cycle time of the automation line.
Reducing the reality gap in digital twins We reduced the reality gap in the digital twin which allowed us for faster iterations between the real world and the digital twin. This enabled us to optimize the robot movement speed for real-world performance.

Result 1: 16.21% faster robot movement On a first iteration, we achieved a 16.21% increase in robot movement speed by means of modifying trajectories and movements (velocities and accelerations), enabling TEKNIA to speed up their production cycles and increase their manufacturing capacity.
Your browser does not support the video tag.
Result 2: 10.78% faster with dual manipulation We were further challenged to increase the productivity, so we proposed a dual manipulation system. This system allowed for synchronous multi-robot trajectory coordination leading to a 10.78% increase in the manufacturing cycle time.

RobotPerf | Reference benchmarking suite used to evaluate robotics computing performance Products Collaborative Benchmarks Consulting Robot IP design Company Case studies ROS News Do you like cookies?
We use cookies to ensure you get the best experience on our website.
RobotPerf Benchmarks The benchmarking suite to evaluate robotics computing performance RobotPerf™ provides an open reference benchmarking suite that is used to evaluate robotics , so that robotic architects can make informed decisions about the hardware and software components of their robotic systems.
RobotPerf™ source code RobotPerf™ reports Robot computations can improve when the right computing platform is selected Benchmarking is the act of running a computer program with a known workload to assess the program's relative performance. Performance information can help roboticists design more efficient robotic systems and select the right hardware for their robotic application.
The performance benchmarking suite in robotics The myriad combinations of robot hardware and robotics software make assessing robotic-system performance challenging, specially in an architecture-neutral, representative, and reproducible manner.
RobotPerf™ addresses this issue delivering a reference performance benchmarking suite that is used to evaluate robotics computing performance across CPU, GPU, FPGA and other compute accelerators. The benchmarks are designed to be representative of the performance of a robotic system and to be reproducible across different robotic systems. For that, , the de facto standard for robot application development.
Mission Represented by consortium of robotics leaders from industry, academia and research labs, RobotPerf™ is formated as an open project whose mission is to build open, fair and useful robotics benchmarks that are technology agnostic, vendor-neutral and provide unbiased evaluations of robotics computing performance for hardware, software, and services.
Purpose Benchmarking assists in performance evaluation. Roboticists can use performance data to develop more efficient robotic systems and choose the appropriate hardware for each robotic application with the help of performance data. It can also aid in comprehending the trade-offs between algorithms implementing the same skill.
Standards RobotPerf™ aligns to robotics standards so that you don’t spend time reinventing the wheel and re-develop what already works for most. Particularly benchmarks are conducted using the as its common baseline. RobotPerf™ also aligns to standardization initiatives within the ROS ecosystem related to computing performance and benchmarking such as REP 2008 ( ). See the RobotPerf™ Specification for more details.
RobotPerf™ source code Why?
Robot behaviors take the form of computational graphs, with data flowing between computation Nodes, across physical networks (communication buses) and while mapping to underlying sensors and actuators. The popular choice to build these computational graphs for robots these days is the Robot Operating System (ROS), a framework for robot application development. ROS enables you to build computational graphs and create robot behaviors by providing libraries, a communication infrastructure, drivers and tools to put it all together. Most companies building real robots today use ROS or similar event-driven software frameworks. ROS is thereby the common language in robotics, with several hundreds of companies and thousands of developers ROS and solves many of the problems in building reliable robotics systems.
vendor solutions support, and with a variety of modular packages, each implementing a different robotics feature that simplifies performance benchmarking in robotics.

More about ROS Robotics Computing Performance: Visualizing For robotic architects, delving into the multifaceted dimensions of computing performance is crucial, yet often intricate. RobotPerf™ stands as a beacon in this space, offering a range of visualizations tailored for clarity and depth. One such illustration is the polar plot, which displays benchmarks within a particular robotic computing category on separate axes. Through RobotPerf™, architects can instantly perceive a system's proficiency across these benchmarks.
They can pinpoint both the strengths and areas of improvement, and thereby make informed decisions in design and optimization. With RobotPerf™, the complexity of robotics computing performance is transformed into actionable insights, making the architect's role not only simpler but also more effective.
Robot Benchmarks : Two benchmarking approaches GREY-BOX is an application-specific measure capable of watching internal states of the system that can measure (probe) certain points in the system, thus generate the measurement data with minimal interference incurring into a minimal average latency of only 3.3 us, making it well-suited for real-time systems. This approach is more complex, but it offers a more detailed analysis, and makes it more appealing for real-world robotic applications and real-time systems, but a less good choice for quick prototyping.
BLACK-BOX measures performance by eliminating the layers above the layer-of-interest and replacing those with a specific test application or compute node. While this approach doesn't need extra instrumentation, and is easier to implement, it offers a less detailed analysis, has limited data points, and uses a non-standard data format while altering the computational graph (introducing new nodes). This makes it less appealing for real-world robotic applications and real-time systems, but a good choice for quick prototyping.
RobotPerf™ categories RobotPerf™ benchmarks aim to cover the complete robotics pipeline including perception , localization , communications middleware , control , manipulation and navigation New categories may appear over time .

Benchmarks Launch your ROS graphs into the cloud Supporting the top cloud service providers Hardware acceleration in the cloud for ROS Leveraging the cloud provides roboticists with unlimited resources to further accelerate computations. Besides lots of CPU, cloud computing providers such as GCP, Azure or AWS offer instances that provide big FPGAs and GPUs for on-cloud hardware acceleration. This means once the ROS graph is partially in the cloud, architects can use custom accelerators to reduce and optimize robotic computations. But tapping into all that power while aligned with common ROS and robotics development flows is non-trivial.

Accelerating metal part manufacturing with robots Heavy metallic parts are manipulated by machinery and robots with tasks involving soldering and assembly. The environment is characterized by large robots and slow-communicating large machinery and equipment, with workers overseeing the slow process. In our work with Grupo Celsa we accelerated their robotic vision pipelines by more than 62x , down to milliseconds, enabling faster robot manipulation and real-time quality control.
The challenge The traditional process of soldering and assembling heavy metallic parts is slow and labor-intensive. These parts often have unstructured surfaces, requiring robots to rely on advanced perception systems powered by computer vision for precise manipulation. The challenge lies in speeding up these perception systems to enhance robotic efficiency and enable real-time quality control.

Robot Operating System (ROS) | Acceleration Robotics Products Collaborative Benchmarks Consulting Robot IP design Company Case studies ROS News Do you like cookies?
We use cookies to ensure you get the best experience on our website.
Robot Operating System (ROS) The de facto framework for robot application development ROS is the common language roboticists use to build robots. It's an open source and modular set of software libraries and tools that help you build robot applications. It provides a message-passing system between software components, drivers for robot hardware, state-of-the-art robotic algorithms, and powerful developer tools to test, debug and visualize your robot.
Why is ROS so important?
Robots are networks of networks, with sensors capturing data, passing to compute technologies, and then on to actuators and back again in a deterministic manner. These networks can be understood as the nervous system of the robot, passing across compute Nodes , that represent neurons . Like the human nervous systems, real-time information across all these computational Nodes is fundamental for the robot to behave coherently.
"Robot brains" are built with this same philosophy. Behaviors take the form of computational graphs, with data flowing between Nodes, across physical networks (communication buses) and while mapping to underlying sensors, compute technologies and actuators.
ROS enables you to build these computational graphs and create robot behaviors by providing libraries, a communication infrastructure, drivers and tools to put it all together.
"Nearly 55% of total commercial robots shipped in 2024 will have at least one ROS package installed, creating a large installed base of ROS-enabled robots."

Other products ROBOTCORE Speed up your ROS tf ) is an optimized robotics transform library that manages efficiently the transformations between coordinate systems in a robot.
tf2 ) library , ROBOTCORE delivers higher throughput and lower latency while aligning with the standard way to keep track of coordinate frames and transform data within a ROS robotic system.
Robotics consulting?
Accelerated coordinate transformations ( tf ) The ROS tf2 library manages the transformations between coordinate systems in a robot. It does so by using a directed single rooted tree that has methods for 1) registration of transformation information and 2) computation of coordinate transformations. The cool thing about tf2 is that it allows to transform data in time as well as in space, which makes it a centric component in the ROS ecosystem being used in popular robotics stacks including navigation2 , moveit2 and Autoware.Auto .
ROBOTCORE introduces architectural upgrades in the tf2 implementation and leverages hardware acceleration to create customized transform data pipelines that deliver higher throughput and lower the latency while reading (or publishing) the tf2 tree. ROBOTCORE is served either as source code or as an IP which allows your ROS computational graphs to easily integrate it. Delivering lower latency and higher throughput , it's API-compatible with tf2 library simplifying its integration in existing robots, so that you don’t spend time reinventing the wheel and re-developing what already works.
Benchmarks Why tf2 ?
To keep track of a robot's position, and the rest of the world in relation to itself tf2 allows roboticists to keep track of multiple coordinate frames over time. It maintains the relationship between coordinate frames in a graph-like data structure (a tree) that is buffered in time, and lets the ROS graph-users to transform data between any two coordinate frames at any desired point in time, provided such point is available within the buffers.
tf2 is generally best understood via example: consider a robot fleet consisting on 3 robots in a warehouse that start from similar positions. Each robot senses the environment using the laser mounted on its top ( base_link_laser frame), as well as the lasers readings from the other robots. The challenge on each robot to integrate all these laser readings requires knowledge of the relationship over time and over space between the laser ( base_link_laser frame), to the base ( base_link frame), to the ground level ( base_footprint frame), to the world frame ( map frame) and back to whichever frame ends up being used to compute the sensor fusion. After all, sensor readings can only be integrated when expressed in the same coordinate frame.
Up to 5x faster tf2 tree operations tf2 sits at the core of navigation2 , moveit2 and Autoware.Auto (among others). For every motion computation, the tf2 tree gets accessed many times. This makes tf2 a very time-sensitive component in high performance robots, wherein both latency and throughput must be carefully considered.
That's where ROBOTCORE comes to play. It introduces architectural upgrades in the tf2 implementation and leverages hardware acceleration delivering a 5x latency speedup in coordinate transformations.
Developer-ready documentation and support is served by seasoned ROS developers and for ROS development.
It ships as a complement to ROBOTCORE either as IP, or as source code. It includes documentation, examples, reference designs and the possibility of various levels of support.

Multiple Cameras for Extended Coverage.
Occlusion Handling If the Occlusion Handling (OH) variant of the control system is enabled, a Depth Grid Map is generated in the form of a file that can live either in the CPU or in the FPGA memory. The Depth Grid Map contains the mapping from one camera, the principal camera, and the other cameras introduced in the system, the secondary cameras. The principal camera's view volume is divided into a grid by dividing it into pixels (in x and y) and by a user-defined depth value in the z-axis, generating a 2.5D frustum. Each cell contains data on the pixel region and depth in which they are visible in other cameras. This mapping is then used to query the different images during the distance evaluation stage. As a result, the system can handle occlusions across cameras and provide a more accurate representation of the robot's environment, enhancing its safety and reliability while delivering the evasive behaviors required for safe human-robot collaboration.
The Control Theory Behind Depth Image-Based Robot Control Our system captures depth images of the robot and its surroundings, requiring calibration of the relative positions between the robot and the camera. The robot's geometry is filtered out, and critical distances from control points on the robot to the surrounding depth camera detections are identified.
Control points are defined using TF frames on the robot's geometry, typically on the axes connecting the joints. These points can be added by including link elements without geometry to the robot's URDF/XACRO model . The distribution of these points should ensure the entire robot is covered within the repulsive potential field's saturation region . The distance between consecutive points should generally be less than \(\left(\frac{-3}{\alpha} + 1\right) \frac{\rho}{2}\). More points increase precision but also computation time.
Based on these distances, a Cartesian repulsive vector and an attractive configuration (PID) vector are computed. These vectors are combined in joint space to obtain a velocity command . The repulsion intensity (\(v_{\text{rep}}\)) is regulated by a curve defined by \(v_{\text{max}}\), \(\rho\), \(d_{\text{min}}\), and \(\alpha\).
This velocity command is limited based on joint velocity limits from other control points and smoothed through an acceleration filter before being transmitted to the robot.
The operation of this system is as follows: A stream of depth images is captured, showing the target robot and its immediate surroundings. The relative positions between the robot and the camera must be calibrated.
The robot's geometry is filtered out from these images.
The filtered image is analyzed to identify critical distances from control points defined on the robot's geometry to the detections from the surrounding depth camera. An example of these control points for a UR10e robot can be seen in the following image. These control points are defined using TF frames located on the robot's geometry, typically on the axes connecting the joints. These points can be simply defined by adding a series of `link` elements without associated geometry to the robot's URDF/XACRO model. The process of adding/modifying these control points to the configuration of the various involved nodes and the controller will be reflected in the documentation provided with the solution code. The distribution of these points along the robot's geometry should generally be sufficient to ensure that the entire volume of the robot is covered within the saturation region of the repulsive potential field function. This function appears in the next step, but as a rule of thumb, the distance between consecutive points should generally be less than \(\left(\frac{-3}{\alpha} + 1\right) \frac{\rho}{2}\). It is worth noting that the greater the number and density of these points, the more precise the coverage of the geometry at the cost of increased computation time.
Based on these distances for the end effector control point, a Cartesian repulsive vector is computed, and based on the current goal, an attractive configuration (PID) vector is also computed. These vectors are combined in joint space to obtain a velocity command. The intensity of the repulsion (\(v_{\text{rep}}\)) is regulated by a curve defined by the attached image: Where \(v_{\text{max}}\) is the maximum Cartesian repulsion velocity, \(\rho\) is the radius around a control point where obstacles are considered, \(d_{\text{min}}\) is the minimum distance from the control point to the obstacle, and \(\alpha\) is a shape factor that regulates the slope of the curve.
This velocity command is then limited based on velocity limits for each joint computed from the other control points.
The joint command limited to these new limits is smoothed through an acceleration filter.
This smoothed command is transmitted to the robot.

Our benchmarking frame- work provides ready-to-use tools and is easily adaptable for the from the knowledge of leading robot architects and system architecture experts, RobotPerf establishes a standardized ap- proach to robotics benchmarking. As an open-source initiative, RobotPerf remains committed to evolving with community input to advance the future of hardware-accelerated robotics.
I. I NTRODUCTION In order for robotic systems to operate safely and effec- tive in dynamic real-world environments, their computations must run at real-time rates while meeting power constraints.
Towards this end, accelerating robotic kernels on heteroge- neous hardware, such as GPUs and FPGAs, is emerging as a crucial tool for enabling such performance [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7]. This is particularly important given the impending end of Moore’s Law and the end of Dennard Scaling, which limits single CPU performance [8], [9].
While hardware-accelerated kernels offer immense poten- tial, they necessitate a reliable and standardized infrastructure to be effectively integrated into robotic systems. As the industry leans more into adopting such standard software infrastructure, the Robot Operating System (ROS) [10] has emerged as a favored choice. Serving as an industry-grade middleware, it aids in building robust computational robotics graphs, reinforcing the idea that robotics is more than just in- combined with the computational improvements offered by hardware acceleration, accentuates the community’s demand for a standardized, industry-grade benchmark to evaluate var- ied hardware solutions. Recently, there has been a plethora of workshops and tutorials focusing on benchmarking robotics applications [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], 1Acceleration Robotics, Spain.2Alpen-Adria-Universit ¨at Klagenfurt, Austria.3Harvard University, USA.4Georgia Institute of Technology, USA.

In this paper, we introduce RobotPerf , an open-source and community-driven benchmarking tool designed to assess the performance of robotic computing systems in a standardized, architecture-neutral, and reproducible way, accommodating the various combinations of hardware and software in dif- ferent robotic platforms (see Figure 1). RobotPerf focuses computational graphs on a wide array of hardware setups, encompassing a complete robotics pipeline and emphasizingarXiv:2309.09212v2 [cs.RO] 29 Jan 2024 real-time critical metrics. The framework incorporates two distinct benchmarking methodologies that utilize various forms of instrumentation and ROS nodes to capture critical metrics in robotic systems. These approaches are: black-box testing, which measures performance by eliminating upper layers and replacing them with a test application, and grey- box testing, an application-specific measure that observes internal system states with minimal interference. The frame- work is user-friendly, easily extendable for evaluating custom hardware acceleration vendors for a standardized benchmark- ing approach. It aims to foster research and innovation as an open-source project. We validate the framework’s capabilities by conducting benchmarks on diverse hardware platforms, including CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs, thereby showcasing RobotPerf’s utility in drawing valuable performance insights.
RobotPerf’s source code and documentation are available athttps://github.com/robotperf/benchmarks and its methodologies are currently being used in industry to benchmark industry-strength, production-grade systems.
II. B ACKGROUND & R ELATED WORK ROS [10] is a widely-used middleware for robot devel- opment that serves as a structured communications layer and offers a comprehensive suite of additional functionalities including: open-source packages and drivers for various tasks, sensors, and actuators, as well as a collection of tools that simplify development, deployment, and debugging processes. ROS enables the creation of computational graphs (see Figure 1) that connect software processes, known as nodes, through topics, facilitating the development of end- to-end robotic systems. Within this framework, nodes can publish to or subscribe from topics, enhancing the modularity of robotic systems.
to industry Data Distribution Service (DDS) and Real-Time Data Distribution Service (DDS) standard, it enables fine- grained, direct, inter- and intra-node communication, enhanc- ing performance, reducing latency, and improving scalability.
Importantly, these improvements are also designed to support hardware acceleration [30], [5]. Over 600 companies have environments, underscoring its significance and widespread adoption in the industry [11].

ing their performance as well as a plethora of workshops and tutorials focusing on benchmarking robotics applica- tions [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22]. However, most of these robotics benchmarks focus on algorithm correctness ( functional testing) in the context of domain specific problems, as well as end-to-end latency on CPUs [31], [32], [33], [34], [37], [35], [38], [36], [39], [40], [41], [42], [43], [44], [45], [46], [47], [48]. A few works also analyze some non-functional metrics, such as CPU performance benchmarks, to explore bottleneck behaviors in selected workloads [23], [24], [49].
Recent work has also explored the implications of oper- graph performance through benchmarking [50], [51], [52], [53], [54] as well as by optimizing the scheduling and com- [57], [58], [59], [60], [61], [62]. These works often focused on a specific context or (set of) performance counter(s).
Finally, previous work has leveraged hardware acceler- ation for select ROS Nodes and adaptive computing to optimize the ROS computational graphs [63], [64], [65], [66], [67], [68], [69], [70], [71], [72], [73], [74], [75], [76], [77], [78], [79]. However, these works do not provide comprehensive frameworks to quickly analyze and evaluate new heterogeneous computational graphs except for two works that are limited to the context of UA Vs [25], [28].
Research efforts most closely related to our work include ros2 tracing [80] and RobotCore [5]. ros2 tracing provided instrumentation that demonstrated integration with illuminates the advantages of using vendor-specific tracing to complement ros2 tracing to assess the performance two specific foundational contributions, RobotPerf offers a pipeline and evaluates them on diverse hardware.
Table I summarizes our unique contributions. It includes a selection of representative benchmarks from above and provides an evaluation of these benchmarks against Robot- Perf, focusing on essential characteristics vital for robotic systems. We note that while our current approach focuses only on non-functional performance benchmarking tests, RobotPerf’s architecture and methodology can be extended to also measure functional metrics.
III. R OBOT PERF: PRINCIPLES & M ETHODOLOGY RobotPerf is an open-source, industry-strength robotics benchmark for portability across heterogeneous hardware platforms. This section outlines the important design prin- ciples and describes the implementation methodology.
A. Non-Functional Performance Testing Currently, RobotPerf specializes in non-functional perfor- mance testing, evaluating the efficiency and operational char- acteristics of robotic systems. Non-functional performance testing measures those aspects not belonging to the system’s functions, such as computational latency, memory consump- tion, and CPU usage. In contrast, traditional functional performance testing looks into the system’s specific tasks and function, verifying its effectiveness in its primary goals, like the accuracy of the control algorithm in following a planned robot’s path. While functional testing confirms a system performs its designated tasks correctly, non-functional testing ensures it operates efficiently and reliably.
computational graphs, rather than focusing on independent for the easy composition of complex robotic systems. This makes the benchmark versatile and well-suited for a wide range of robotic applications and enables industry, which is widely using ROS, to rapidly adopt RobotPerf.
C. Platform Independence & Portability RobotPerf allows for the evaluation of benchmarks on a variety of hardware platforms, including general-purpose CPUs and GPUs, reconfigurable FPGAs, and specialized ac- celerators (e.g., ray tracing accelerators [81]). Benchmarking robotic workloads on heterogeneous platforms is vital to evaluate their respective capabilities and limitations. This fa- cilitates optimizations for efficiency, speed, and adaptability, as well as fine-tuning of resource allocations, ensuring robust and responsive operation across diverse contexts.
D. Flexible Methodology We offer grey-box and black-box testing methods to suit different needs. Black-box testing provides a quick-to-enable external perspective and measures performance by eliminat- ing the layers above the layer-of-interest and replacing thoseCRITERIA Grey-Box Black-Box PRECISION Utilizes tracers from in- sage subscriptions.
PERFORMANCE Low overhead. Driven by sage callbacks. Recorded by userspace processes.
FLEXIBILITY Multiple event types. Limited to message sub- scriptions in current im- plementation.
PORTABILITY Requires a valid tracer.

EASE OF USE Requires code modifica- tions and data postpro- cessing.Tests unmodified soft- ware with minor node additions.

with a specific test application. Grey-box testing provides more granularity and dives deeper into the internal workings ments at the cost of increased engineering effort. As such, each method has its trade-offs, and providing both options enables users flexibility. We describe each method in more detail below and highlight takeaways in Table II.
1) Grey-Box Testing: Grey-box testing enables precise probe placement within a robot’s computational graph, gen- erating a chronologically ordered log of critical events using a tracer that could be proprietary or open source, such as LTTng [82]. As this approach is fully integrated with incurs a minimal average latency of only 3.3 µ s[80], making it well-suited for real-time systems. With this approach, optionally, RobotPerf offers specialized input and output nodes that are positioned outside the nodes of interest to avoid the need to instrument them. These nodes generate the message tracepoints upon publish and subscribe events which are processed to calculate end-to-end latency.
2) Black-Box Testing: The black-box methodology uti- lizes a user-level node called the MonitorNode to evaluate scribes to the target node, recording the timestamp when each message is received. By accessing the propagated ID, the MonitorNode determines the end-to-end latency by com- paring its timestamp against the PlaybackNode ’s recorded timestamp for each message. While this approach does not need extra instrumentation, and is easier to implement, it offers a less detailed analysis and alters the computational graph by introducing new nodes and dataflow.
E. Opaque Performance Tests The requirement for packages to be instrumented directly within the source code poses a challenge to many bench- marking efforts. To overcome this hurdle, for most bench- marks, we refrain from altering the workloads of interest and, instead, utilize specialized input and output nodes positioned outside the primary nodes of concern. This setup allows for benchmarking without the need for direct instrumentation of Category Benchmark Name Description a2rectify rectify component [83], [84].

the target layer. We term this methodology “opaque tests,” a concept that RobotPerf adheres to when possible.
F . Reproducibility & Consistency To ensure consistent and reproducible evaluations, Robot- Perf adheres to specific common robotic dataformats. In par- athttps://github.com/robotperf/rosbags , as well third-party bags (e.g., the r2b dataset [99]).
To ensure consistent data loading and finer control over message delivery rates, we drew inspiration from [100].
Our computational graphs incorporate modified and im- proved DataLoaderNode andPlaybackNode imple- mentations, which can be accessed at https://github .com/robotperf/ros2_benchmark . These enhanced nodes offer improvements that report worst-case latency and enable the reporting of maximum latency, introduce the ability to profile power consumption and so forth.
G. Metrics We focus on three key metrics: latency, throughput and power consumption including energy efficiency. Latency measures the time between the start and the completion of a task. Throughput measures the total amount of work done in a given time for a task. Power measures the electrical energy per unit of time consumed while executing a given task. Measuring energy efficiency (or performance-per-Watt) captures the total amount of work (relative to either through- put or latency) that can be delivered for every watt of power consumed and is directly related to the runtime of battery powered robots [25].
H. Current Benchmarks and Categories RobotPerf beta [98] introduces benchmarks that cover the robotics pipeline from perception, to localization, tocontrol, as well as dedicated benchmarks for manipulation.
The full list of benchmarks in the beta release can be found in Table III. Aligned with our principles defined above, describes all dependencies (generally other ROS packages).
To facilitate reproducibility, all benchmarks are designed to flows ( ament build tools, colcon meta-build tools, etc.).
Finally, so that the benchmarks can be easily consumed by other tools, a description of each benchmark, as well as its results, is defined in a machine-readable format. As such, accompanying the package.xml andCMakeLists.txt files required for all ROS packages, a YAML file named benchmark.yaml is in the root of each benchmark which describes the benchmark and includes accepted results.
I. Run Rules To ensure the reliability and reproducibility of the perfor- mance data, we adhere to a stringent set of run rules. First, tests are performed in a controlled environment to ensure that performance data is not compromised by fluctuating external parameters. As per best practices recommended by ros2 tracing [80], we record and report settings like clock frequency and core count. Second, we look forward to the possibility of RobotPerf being embraced by the community and have results undergo peer review, which can contribute to enhancing reproducibility and accuracy. Finally, we aim to avoid overfitting to specific hardware setups or software configurations by encompassing a broad spectrum of test scenarios.
IV. E VALUATION We conduct comprehensive benchmarking using Robot- Perf to evaluate its capabilities on three key aspects vital for a robotics-focused computing benchmark. First, we validate the framework’s capacity to provide comparative insights across divergent heterogeneous platforms from edge devices to server-class hardware. Second, we analyze the results to understand RobotPerf’s ability to guide selection of the optimal hardware solution tailored to particular robotic work- loads. Finally, we assess how effectively RobotPerf reveals the advantages conferred by hardware and software acceler- ation techniques relative to general-purpose alternatives. All of our results and source code can be found open-source at: https://github.com/robotperf/benchmarks .
A. Fair and Representative Assessment of Heterogeneity Assessing hardware heterogeneity in robotic applications is imperative in the ever-evolving field of robotics. Different robotic workloads demand varying computational resources and efficiency levels. Therefore, comprehensively evaluating performance across diverse hardware platforms is crucial.
We evaluated the RobotPerf benchmarks over a wide list of hardware platforms, including general-purpose CPUs on edge devices (e.g., Qualcomm RB5), server-class CPUs (e.g., Intel i7-8700), and specialized hardware accelerators (e.g., AMD Kria KR260). Figure 3 illustrates benchmark performance in robotics per category of workload (percep- tion, localization, control, and manipulation) using radar plots, wherein the different hardware solutions are depicted together alongside different robotic workloads per category.
Each hardware solution is presented with a different color, with smaller values and areas representing better perfor- mance in the respective category. Given our ability to benchmark 18 platforms (bottom of Figure 3), RobotPerf is capable of benchmarking heterogeneous hardware platforms and workloads, paving the way for community-driven co- design and optimization of hardware and software.
B. Quantitative Approach to Hardware Selection The rapid evolution and diversity of tasks in robotics means we need to have a meticulous and context-specific ap- proach to computing hardware selection and optimization. A “one-size-fits-all” hardware strategy would be an easy default selection, but it fails to capitalize on the nuanced differences in workload demands across diverse facets like perception, localization, control, and manipulation, each exhibiting dis- tinctive sensitivities to hardware capabilities. Therefore, a rigorous analysis, guided by tools like RobotPerf, becomes essential to pinpoint the most effective hardware configura- tions that align well with individual workload requirements.
The results in Figure 3 demonstrate the fallacy of a “one- size-fits-all” solution. For example, focusing in on the latency radar plot for control from Figure 3 (col 3, row 1), we see that the i7-12700H (I7H) outperforms the NVIDIA AGX Orin Dev. Kit (NO) on benchmarks C1,C3,C4, and C5, but is 6.5×slower on benchmark C2. As such, by analyzing data from the RobotPerf benchmarks, roboticists can better determine which hardware option best suits their needs given their specific workloads and performance requirements.
One general lesson learned while evaluating the data is that each workload is unique, making it hard to general- 3.3x 4.4x 11.5xFig. 2: Benchmark comparison of perception latency (ms) on AMD’s Kria KR260 with and without the ROBOTCORE a5as defined in Table III. We find that hardware acceleration can enable performance gains of as much as 11.5 ×.
ize across both benchmarks and categories. To that end, RobotPerf results help us understand how the use of various hardware solutions and dedicated domain-specific hardware accelerators significantly improves the performance.
C. Rigorous Assessment of Acceleration Benefits In the rapidly advancing field of computing hardware, the optimization of algorithm implementations is a crucial factor in determining the success and efficiency of robotic applications. The need for an analytical tool, like RobotPerf, that facilitates the comparison of various algorithmic imple- mentations on uniform hardware setups becomes important.
Figure 2 is a simplified version of Figure 3, depicting AMD’s Kria KR260 hardware solution in two forms: the usual hardware and a variant that leverages a domain- soft-core running in the FPGA for accelerating perception robotic computations). The figure demonstrates that hardware acceleration can enable performance gains of as much as 11.5×(from 173 ms down to 15 ms for benchmark a5). We stress that the results obtained here should be interpreted according to each end application and do not represent a generic recommendation on which hardware should be used.
Other factors, including availability, the form factor, and community support, are relevant aspects to consider when selecting a hardware solution.
V. C ONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK RobotPerf represents an important step towards stan- dardized benchmarking in robotics. With its comprehensive evaluation across the hardware/software stack and focus on way for rigorous co-design of robotic hardware and algo- rithms. As RobotPerf matures with community involvement, we expect it to compare CPU, GPU and FPGA, exploring their power consumption and flexibility in augmenting real- world robotic computations. With a standardized robotics benchmark as a focal point, the field can make rapid progress in delivering real-time capable systems that will unlock the true potential of robotics in real-world applications.

Radar plots illustrate the latency, throughput, and power consumption for each hardware solution and workload, with reported values representing the maximum across a series of runs. The labels of vertices represent the workloads defined in Table III. Each hardware platform and performance testing procedure is delineated by a separate color, with darker colors representing Black-box testing and lighter colors Grey-box testing. In the figure’s key, the hardware platforms are categorized into four specific types: general-purpose hardware, heterogeneous hardware, reconfigurable hardware, and accelerator hardware. Within each category, the platforms are ranked based on their Thermal Design Power (TDP), which indicates the maximum power they can draw under load. The throughput values for manipulation tasks and power values for localization tasks have not been incorporated into the beta version of RobotPerf.
As RobotPerf continues to evolve, more results will be added in subsequent iterations.

Hardware Acceleration solutions for the robotics architect pg. 60 Robotic Processing Units pg. 61 T ools and Robot IP Cores pg. 62 References 6 Hardware Acceleration Report in Robotics2022 7 Executive Summary 8 Robots are deterministic machines. Meeting time deadlines in their computations (real-time) is the most important feature however other characteristics are also of relevance while designing robotic computations including the time between the start and the completion of a task (latency), the total amount of work done in a given time (bandwidth or throughput) or that a task happens in exactly the same timeframe, each time (determinism). CPUs are widely used in robotics due to their availability however they hardly provide real-time and safety guarantees while delivering high throughput. Hardware acceleration ( with either FPGAs, GPUs or other accelerators) presents an answer to this problem. One that allows the robotics architect to create custom computing architectures for robots that comply with real-time and bandwidth requirements, while lowering power consumption.
Hardware acceleration has the potential to revolutionize robotics, enabling new applications by speeding up robot response times while remaining power-efficient. However, the diversity of acceleration options makes it difficult for roboticists to select the right computational resource for each task. This report captures the state-of-the art of hardware acceleration in robotics by following a quantitative approach and presents robotic architects with a resource to consider while designing their robot computational architectures. The report compares the most popular computation solutions in robotics used today through reproducible and Acceleration Working Group GitHub organization.
Since most companies building real robots today use ROS or similar event-driven software frameworks, this report uses ROS as the common baseline in robotics to conduct the study (section 2.2). In particular, we framework for robot application development and consider both bandwidth and latency to benchmark performance in robotics (section 2.3) using a grey-box and non-functional benchmarking approach (section 2.4).
9 Hardware Acceleration Report in Robotics2022 The work presented in this report happened in two phases. First, a community survey conducted in both the ROS and the overall robotics communities helped grasp the interest behind the use of hardware acceleration in robotics.
Input from this community survey was then used to drive the second phase, a hardware acceleration benchmarking effort. The most relevant results from these two phases are summarized below: Community Survey Only about half of the respondents (51%, section 3 .1 ) is confident about the value and differences between hardware acceleration solutions for robotics: Only 62.5% (section 3.2) have ever programmed an acceleration kernel.
This suggests that there’s still a lot of work to be done from silicon vendors’ side to further simplify the use and integration of their solutions.
The majority of the roboticists currently use GPUs (69.8%, section 3. 11) versus FPGAs (21.9%): Roboticists seem to care about speed or latency (48.9%, shorter execution time) as much as real-time and determinism (46.8%). Only a reduced 4.3% would prioritize power consumption (section 3. 10).
This indicates that there’s margin for FPGA usage growth in the ROS robotics community .

Considering mean runtime measurements (in ms, Figure 15, section 4.2), the use of a CPU + FPGA combination delivers a 3.56x speedup over a comparable CPU + GPU, and a 1.36x speedup over a comparable CPU.
When considering a more powerful CPU + GPU combination (Figure 17 , section 4.2), the FPGA still outperforms it with a 1.59x speedup.

T o discriminate between any possible differences between the CPU cores, measurements were collected isolating perception computations by infrastructure overhead, as well as the host-device (GPU or FPGA) data transfer overhead.
Popular perception algorithms such as the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) show a 500x speedup in an FPGA and relative to a comparable GPU (Figure 22).Benchmarking hardware acceleration 11 Hardware Acceleration Report in Robotics2022 11Figure 0 Performance-per- watt benchmark perception graph across various accelerators.

2.5 2 1.5 1 0.5 0 CPU + FPGA (KR260) CPU + FPGA ( Jetson Nano)CPU + GPU ( Jetson AGX Xavier) Overall, results hint that the rate at which the energy consumption grows with GPU solutions seems to be smaller than the rate at which the latency performance improves, which leads to a decaying performance-per- GPU + CPU solutions. Instead, FPGA-enabled solutions present a performance-per-watt figure that’s 6x ( 5.93x) better than the one observed in comparable GPU + CPU sets and 8x (7 .95x) better than the one in more power GPU + CPU sets.
These results indicate that using bandwidth as the only measure of performance can be misleading in ROS and robotics. Moreover, data suggests that when considering latency as the measure of performance, GPU sets may struggle to find themselves on equal footing with their FPGA counterparts.
There are nevertheless various advantages that GPUs inherently have and that should be considered while building complex robotic computations. Moreover, though FPGA kernel runtime execution outperforms their GPU counterparts, it’s relevant to note that FPGAs are resource-limited and thereby it’s important to consider that only a fixed set of accelerators would be able to fit within an FPGA at any given point in time whereas the GPUs don’t have this limitation due to their architectures.
Scalable robot compute architectures that consider hardware acceleration should look at combining CPUs, GPUs and FPGAs to obtain the best trade-off.
12 Hardware Acceleration Report in Robotics2022 13 Introduction 14The CPU whack-a-mole in robotics Robots are deterministic machines. Meeting time deadlines in their computations (real-time) is the most important feature however other characteristics are also of relevance while designing robotic computations including the time between the start and the completion of a task (latency), the total amount of work done in a given time (bandwidth or throughput) or that a task happens in exactly the same timeframe, each time (determinism).
There’s a critical relationship between the hardware and the software capabilities in a robot. Robotic systems usually have limited on-board resources, including memory , I/O, disk or compute capabilities, making it hard to balance between real-time and bandwidth requirements ( due to limited shared resources), and restricting robots’ reaction capabilities and speed. A key challenge in robotics using general purpose CPUs1 is that they hardly provide real-time and safety guarantees while delivering high throughput. The de facto strategy in industry [1 ] to meet timing deadlines is a laborious, empirical, and case-by-case tuning of the system. This “CPU whack-a-mole” approach in robotics is unsustainable and hard to scale due to the lack of a hardware-supported timing-safe event driven programming interface in CPUs.CPUs hardly provide real-time and safety guarantees while delivering high throughput.
This “CPU whack- a-mole” approach in robotics is unsustainable and hard to scale1 CPUs are widely used in commercial compute platforms in robotics due to their availability and generalized use. The general purpose nature of CPUs makes them specially interesting for roboticists to kickstart projects, however this comes at a cost when translating into real applications: their fixed architectures and limited amount of resources difficult adaptability to new ( computing) robotic scenarios and always impose a trade-off between performance and determinism.2 .1 15 Hardware Acceleration Report in Robotics2022 Hardware acceleration with dedicated compute architectures (in either FPGAs, GPUs or other accelerators) is presented as an alternative to CPUs.
One that allows the architect to adaptively generate custom computing architectures to meet the robotic computing demands, delivering a solution that can comply with real-time and bandwidth requirements while increasing reliability and lowering power consumption. Hardware acceleration is presented as an alternative to CPUs delivering a solution that can comply with real-time and bandwidth requirementsThis report presents robotic architects with a resource to consider while designing their robot computational architectures that describes how hardware acceleration can improve their performance. T o study the capabilities of hardware acceleration in robotics, this article follows a quantitative approach [2] to measure performance and compares the most popular hardware Results presented in this report are meant to be reproducible and disclosed as open source examples Acceleration Working Group GitHub organization repositories.
baseline in robotics Robot behaviors take the form of computational graphs, with data flowing between computation Nodes, across physical networks ( communication buses) and while mapping to underlying sensors and actuators. The popular choice to build these computational graphs for robots these days is the Robot Operating System (ROS) [3], a framework for robot application development. ROS enables you to build computational graphs and create robot behaviors by providing libraries, a communication infrastructure, drivers and tools to put it all together. Most companies building real robots today use ROS or similar event-driven software frameworks. ROS is thereby the common language in robotics, with several hundreds of companies and thousands of developers using it to address some of the challenges in ROS and solves many of the problems in building reliable robotics systems.
robot application development most silicon vendor solutions support, and with a variety of modular packages, each implementing a different robotics feature that simplifies performance benchmarking in robotics.2.2 17 Hardware Acceleration Report in Robotics2022 Bandwidth, latency and performance considerations The field of robotics is changing rapidly and must be studied with real examples and measurements on real robotic computations, rather than simply as a collection of definitions, designs and marketing actions. The quantitative approach [2] to robotics systems architecture fits well in this context and helps robotic architects come up with better performing architectures through an empirical strategy , and case-by-case tuning of the system.
In robotics bandwidth or throughput is the total amount of work done in a given time, such as the publication feed resulting from processing the data of a camera, or the second) of a processed point cloud coming from a depth sensor. In contrast, latency or response time is the time between the start and the completion of a task, such as T opic subscription in a computational graph.
When speaking about performance in robotics, both bandwidth and latency should be taken into consideration. In particular, given the importance of real- time in robotics we’ d generally be interested in the latency for performance benchmarking. 2.3 A final consideration is the bandwidth/latency performance improvement ratio in robotics. A simple rule of thumb in ( general) computation is that bandwidth grows by at least the square of the improvement in latency. Robotic architects should take this into consideration while designing their robotic systems.When speaking about performance in robotics, both bandwidth and latency should be taken in consideration 18Methodology for benchmarking performance Benchmarking is the act of running a computer program to assess its relative performance. In the context of hardware acceleration, it’s fundamental to assess the relative performance of an acceleration kernel versus its CPU scalar computing baseline. Similarly , benchmarking helps comparing acceleration kernels across hardware acceleration technology solutions ( e.g. FPGA_A vs FPGA_B or FPGA_A vs GPU_A, etc.) and across kernel implementations ( within the same hardware acceleration technology solution).
There’re different types of benchmarking approaches. The following diagram depicts the most popular inspired by [5] : Figure 1 Performance benchmarking approaches.

2 and its computational graph. If necessary , they should instrument the communications middleware and its underlying layers.
Intra-process, inter-process and intra-network: Measures conducted should consider communication within a process in the same SoC, between processes in an SoC and between different SoCs connected in the same network (intra-network).
Compute substrate-agnostic: benchmarks should be able to run on different hardware acceleration technology solutions. For that purpose, a CPU-centric framework (as opposed to an acceleration technology-specific framework) that can be integrated in various accelerators for benchmarking and/or tracing is the ideal choice.
Automated: benchmarks and related source code should be designed with automation in mind. Once ready , creating a benchmark and producing results should be (ideally ) a fully automated process.
Hardware farm mindset: benchmarks will be conducted on hardware embedded platforms sitting in a farm-like environment (redundancy of tests, multiple SoCs/boards) with the intent of validating and comparing different technologies.
Accounting for all of this, and similar to the ROS Enhancement Proposal (REP) REP-2008 proposal [6 ] , in this report we adopt a grey-box and non-functional benchmarking approach for hardware acceleration that allows to evaluate the relative complete computational graphs. T o realize it in a technology agnostic-manner, we select the Linux T racing T oolkit next generation (L TT ng) which will be used for tracing and benchmarking.Differences between tracing and benchmarking T racing and benchmarking can be better understood as follows: T racing: a technique used to understand what goes on in a running software system.
Benchmarking: a method of comparing the performance of various systems by running a common test.
From these definitions, inherently one can determine that both benchmarking and tracing are connected in the sense that the test/benchmark will use a series of measurements for comparison.
These measurements will come from tracing probes. In other words, tracing will collect data that will then be fed into a benchmark program for comparison.2 .4.1 20 Hardware Acceleration Report in Robotics2022 21 Community Survey 22Are you familiar with the different hardware acceleration solutions and their advantages (e.g. FPGAs vs GPUs) 96 answers 46,9% 51%3.1 Figure 2 Results from the “Hardware acceleration in survey” (link) question: “ Are you familiar with the different hardware acceleration solutions and their advantages Gazebo?

38Robotics perception helps sense the static and dynamic objects, and build a reliable and detailed representation of the robot’s environment using computer vision and machine learning techniques. Data obtained in a robot from its sensors like cameras and LIDAR is typically fed into the perception layer turning into something useful for decision making and planning physical actions. The perception layer in a robot is thereby responsible for object detection, segmentation and tracking. T raditionally , a perception pipeline starts with image pre-processing, followed by a region of interest detector and then a classifier that outputs (Components more specifically ) that can be used to build perception pipelines easily .Case study: Hardware subsections will follow the methodology described in section 2.4.

With plenty of attendance in each one of its meetings12 and with the participation of multiple silicon vendors, the group is arguably one of the most active ones in the ROS robotics domain.
Hardware Acceleration Working Group during 2021 and 2022 suggests that there’s an increasingly evident interest in the use of hardware acceleration solutions in robotics and 2022 suggests that there’s an increasingly evident interest in the use of hardware acceleration solutions in robotics, however, the community survey conducted hints that only about half of the respondents (51%, section 3 .1) is confident about the value and differences between hardware (section 3.2) have ever programmed an acceleration kernel, the majority of which used NVIDIA CUDA ( 80.3%, section 3.4). This suggests that there’s still a lot of work to be done from silicon vendors’ side to further simplify the use and integration of their solutions in the ROS robotics ecosystem and provide comprehensive documentation. The previous statement is confirmed by section 3.3 which highlights what aspects of hardware acceleration are of most relevance to roboticists using ROS. Unsurprisingly , we find that more than half of the respondents ( 52. 1%) indicate that a simpler integration with ROS 2 and its ecosystem of tools is of most relevance to them: tools 19.8% and acceleration firmware 20.8%) 32.3% - Capabilities to easily switch between hardware accelerated and CPU-centric Nodes 11.5% - Benchmarking capabilities for hardware acceleration 4. 1% - Others12 See https: // github.

55 Hardware Acceleration Report in Robotics2022 When looking at which packages or components of ROS 2 and Gazebo roboticists would like to accelerate first (section 3.5, multiple selections allowed), we find that demanded group of packages to be accelerated. This is closely followed by “Gazebo physics engines’’ ( 60.4%), navigation2 ( 40.6%), “DDS communication middleware” These numbers are also confirmed by individual answers provided in sections 3.6 and 3 . 7.
The majority of the respondents (92.7%) indicated that they’d prefer the commercially friendly Apache 2.0 license for hardware acceleration resources and libraries (section 3.8). When asked about the format of acceleration kernels, opposed to 18.9% which would be fine with just binaries, 74.8% would prefer source code access to acceleration kernels with code examples (section 3.9).
One surprising aspect encountered while conducting the survey is that roboticists seem to care about speed or latency ( 48.9%, shorter execution time) as much as real-time and determinism ( 46.8%). Only a reduced 4.3% would prioritize power consumption as indicated in section 3. 10. This is somewhat counter-intuitive when looking at how the majority of the roboticists currently use GPUs (69.8%, section 3. 11) versus FPGAs (21.9%), since after all, it’s widely accepted that FPGAs outperform GPUs and CPUs while delivering real-time and determinism in computations, and with lower power consumption. T o add to this conflict, section 3. 14 hints that hardware acceleration is mostly used to create battery-powered robots (and thereby power-sensitive) with roboticists creating autonomous mobile robots (AMRs, 36.4%) followed by drones ( 19.8%), industrial robotic arms ( 12.5%) and legged robots ( 5.2%).
This indicates that there’s margin for FPGA usage growth in the ROS robotics community.
The numbers of type of accelerator usage (section 3. 11) are coherent with the most popular commercial solutions (section 3. 13) with NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier being the leading solution (33.3%) followed by both the NVIDIA Jetson Nano ( 15.6%) and the AMD’s Zynq UltraScale embedded portfolio ( 15.6%, including Kria® boards).
Roboticists seem to care about speed or latency ( 48.9%, shorter execution time) as much as real-time and determinism ( 46.8%) Finally , Ubuntu seems to be the dominant (79.5%, section 3. 15) operating system requested by ROS roboticists for hardware acceleration. Ubuntu 20.04 is the preferred option ( 59%) versus Ubuntu 22.04 (20.5%). Y octo- based rootfs are the second most popular choice with 7 .7% of the respondents preferring it. As for packaging mechanisms, .deb files are the preferred option ( 59%, section 3. 16) followed by Docker containers (23. 1%).There’s still a lot of work to be done from silicon vendors’ side to further simplify the use and integration of their solutions in the ROS robotics ecosystem 56The results obtained across benchmarks performed on a simple pre- (time between the start and the completion of a task) show that optimized FPGA accelerators outperform their GPU counterparts, even when using powerful GPUs. Considering mean runtime measurements (in ms, Figure 15, section 4.2), the use of CPU + FPGA13 deliver a 3.56x speedup over a comparable CPU + GPU14, and a 1.36x speedup over a comparable CPU15.
When considering a more powerful CPU + GPU16 combination (Figure 17 , section 4.2), the FPGA still outperforms it with a 1.59x speedup.
T o further study these results and to discriminate between any possible differences between the two CPUs used (A53 cores in KR260 and the A57 passing infrastructure overhead and reports on the perception computations in the graph. Results show how perception computations in the FPGA have a 4.27x speedup relative to their GPU counterparts when running in the Jetson Nano.
Latency results obtained across benchmarks performed on show that optimized FPGA accelerators outperform their GPU counterparts, even when using powerful GPUs Performance improvements in the form of latency with dedicated acceleration kernels in FPGAs are further evident when considering the power domain.

2.5 2 1.5 1 0.5 0 CPU + FPGA (KR260) CPU + FPGA ( Jetson Nano)CPU + GPU 57 Hardware Acceleration perception graph, we observe that the FPGA designs are much more power efficient than their GPU counterparts. The KR260 presents a performance-per- watt figure that's 6x ( 5.93x) better than the one in the Jetson Nano and 8x (7 .95x) better than the one in the Jetson AGX Xavier. An interesting observation can be made here comparing the performance-per-watt results obtained from the Jetson Nano and the Jetson AGX Xavier: the Xavier features a more powerful CPU and GPU, which consumes more energy while performing computations, however the latency performance of these computations do not scale in the same manner as the energy consumption. What these results hint is that the rate at which the energy consumption grows with NVIDIA Jetson (CPU + GPU) solutions seems to be smaller than the rate at which the latency performance improves, which leads to a decaying performance- statement links back to the rule of thumb shared in section 2.3 that emphasized how “bandwidth grows by at least the square of the improvement in latency” .
With GPUs often focusing on bandwidth to measure performance, when considering latency as the measure of performance GPUs struggle to find themselves on equal footing with their FPGA counterparts.
The rate at which the energy consumption grows with NVIDIA Jetson (CPU + GPU) solutions seems to be smaller than the rate at which the latency performance improves, which leads to a decaying performance- per-watt in our measurementsThere are nevertheless various advantages that GPUs inherently have and that should be considered while building complex robotic computations. Moreover, though FPGA kernel runtime execution outperforms their GPU counterparts, it’s relevant to note that FPGAs are resource-limited and thereby it’s important to consider that only a fixed set of accelerators would be able to fit within an FPGA at any given point in time whereas the GPUs don’t have this limitation due to their architectures.
Section 4.3 further dives into this and focuses on studying while estimating resources required in an FPGA. T o do so, it isolates perception computations by discarding both as well as the host-device (GPU or FPGA) data transfer overhead. Results depicted over figures 18-33 indicate that those running in a GPU by relevant speedups. All the way up to 500x (Figure 22) in popular perception algorithms running in an FPGA outperform those running in a GPU by relevant speedups. All the way up to 500x in popular perception algorithms such as the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) 58 Hardware Acceleration Report in Robotics2022 59 Hardware Acceleration solutions for the robotics architect Acceleration Robotics is amongst the top experts globally on the Robot Operating System (ROS), hardware acceleration efforts are accelerator-agnostic (FPGAs or GPUs) and robot-agnostic.

Other products ROBOTCORE Speed up your ROS robotics perception pipelines is an optimized robotic perception stack that leverages hardware acceleration to provide a speedup in your perception computations.
, delivers high performance, real-time and reliability to your robots' perception.
Accelerated robotics perception Data obtained in a robot from its sensors like cameras and lidar is typically fed into the perception the static and dynamic objects, and build a reliable and detailed representation of the robot's environment using computer vision and machine learning techniques. The perception layer in a robot is thereby responsible for object detection, segmentation and tracking . Traditionally, a perception pipeline starts with image pre-processing, followed by a region of interest detector and then a classifier that outputs detected objects.
is a hardware accelerated perception stack served as either source code or IP that allows your perception pipelines to reduce their runtime latency and increase throughput. Delivering a perception speedup , it's API-compatible with simplifying its integration in existing robots, so that you don't spend time reinventing the wheel and re-developing what already works.
Benchmarks Default ROS perception 0.7 Hz/image for a 3-Node perception pipeline in embedded A simple Rectify-Resize-Harris ROS perception pipeline is demonstrated which performs pre-processing ( Rectify and Resize ) and region of interest detection ( Harris corners detector). This simple pipeline consisting of only 3 ROS Nodes takes on average 1266.32 milliseconds to execute for a single pass, which leads to less than 1 Hz when running in an idle embedded Quad-core arm Cortex-A53.
ROBOTCORE 4.5x speedup in simple ROS perception pipelines Faster robots require faster perception.
delivers exactly this upgrading perception pipelines with a 4.5x speedup, impacting pipeline runtime and throughput in embedded. More complex perception graphs can further leverage acceleration, achieving 10x speedups and above.
Towards more capable robots Moving faster (or with more dexterity) requires faster perception computations. Edge perception is key to navigate under environments that change, which are most in the human world. The robot below is generating information from its sensors which needs to be processed at the edge (directly in the robot) for smooth behaviors, reducing any latency from the sensors and all the way into the actuators. By leveraging hardware acceleration, robots’ perception extracts information from these sensor readings which is then used to plan actions in the order of tenths of milliseconds. All happening on the edge and responding to environmental changes.
delivers faster perception capabilities to ROS computational graphs. So that your robots can move faster and better.

Other products ROBOTCORE FPGA and GPU hardware acceleration framework for ROS helps build custom compute architectures for robots , or IP cores , directly from ROS workspaces without complex third-party tool integrations. Make your robots faster, more deterministic and/or power-efficient. Simply put, it provides a vendor-agnostic development, build and deployment experience for creating robot hardware and hardware accelerators similar to the standard, non-accelerated ROS development flow.
Read the paper How does it work?
Traditional software development in robotics is about building dataflows with ROS computational graphs. These dataflows go from sensors to compute technologies, all the way down to actuators and back, representing the "brain" of the robot. Generally, ROS computational graphs are built in the CPUs of a given robot. But CPUs have fixed hardware, with pre-defined memory architectures and constraints which limit the performance. Sparked by the decline of Moore's Law and Dennard Scaling, specialized computing units capable of hardware acceleration have proven to be the answer for achieving higher performance in robotics.
allows to easily leverage FPGA and GPU hardware acceleration in a ROS-centric manner and build custom compute architectures for robots, or " IP cores ".
With these IP cores, roboticists can adapt one or simultaneously more of the properties of their computational graphs (e.g., its speed, determinism, power consumption) optimizing the amount of hardware resources and, as a consequence, the performance in an accelerated dataflow .

Accelerating industrial legacy robot manipulation TEKNIA, an auto parts manufacturer, wanted to speed up their existing robots for faster production cycles. We collaborated to achieve first a 16.21% increase in robot movement speed by introducing variations of the robot trajectories, velocities and accelerations, and later, on a second stage a 10.78% decrease in cycle time via double-manipulation. Leveraging modern techniques, we pushed the boundaries of the robot's velocity and acceleration with optimized machine-robot interactions and movements (paths and speed), ensuring efficient movement paths with minimal wasted motions. These improvements empowered TEKNIA to produce an additional 800 units per day and over 20,000 units per month.
The challenge Metallic tubes are manufactured in a continuous process, while going through various stages of production. A robot is used to manipulate the tubes and move them from one stage to another. The robot's speed and acceleration are limiting factors in the production cycle.

We considered the various possibilities, involving the various involved machines, a faster-moving robot, and also multiple robots. We then used this model to determine the optimal combination of the interactions between the robots and the connected machines in the automation line.
Modeling the time-series We modeled the time-series of the robot movements and the machine interactions to optimize the cycle time of the automation line. This allowed us to determine the optimal combination of the interactions between the robots and the connected machines in the automation line.
Digital twin-driven validation We used digital twins to co-develop and validate the optimal time-series model. This allowed us to simulate the robot movements and the machine interactions in a virtual environment, ensuring the optimal cycle time of the automation line.
Reducing the reality gap in digital twins We reduced the reality gap in the digital twin which allowed us for faster iterations between the real world and the digital twin. This enabled us to optimize the robot movement speed for real-world performance.

Result 1: 16.21% faster robot movement On a first iteration, we achieved a 16.21% increase in robot movement speed by means of modifying trajectories and movements (velocities and accelerations), enabling TEKNIA to speed up their production cycles and increase their manufacturing capacity.
Your browser does not support the video tag.
Result 2: 10.78% faster with dual manipulation We were further challenged to increase the productivity, so we proposed a dual manipulation system. This system allowed for synchronous multi-robot trajectory coordination leading to a 10.78% increase in the manufacturing cycle time.

We use cookies to ensure you get the best experience on our website.
RobotPerf Benchmarks The benchmarking suite to evaluate robotics computing performance RobotPerf™ provides an open reference benchmarking suite that is used to evaluate robotics , so that robotic architects can make informed decisions about the hardware and software components of their robotic systems.
RobotPerf™ source code RobotPerf™ reports Robot computations can improve when the right computing platform is selected Benchmarking is the act of running a computer program with a known workload to assess the program's relative performance. Performance information can help roboticists design more efficient robotic systems and select the right hardware for their robotic application.
The performance benchmarking suite in robotics The myriad combinations of robot hardware and robotics software make assessing robotic-system performance challenging, specially in an architecture-neutral, representative, and reproducible manner.
RobotPerf™ addresses this issue delivering a reference performance benchmarking suite that is used to evaluate robotics computing performance across CPU, GPU, FPGA and other compute accelerators. The benchmarks are designed to be representative of the performance of a robotic system and to be reproducible across different robotic systems. For that, , the de facto standard for robot application development.
Mission Represented by consortium of robotics leaders from industry, academia and research labs, RobotPerf™ is formated as an open project whose mission is to build open, fair and useful robotics benchmarks that are technology agnostic, vendor-neutral and provide unbiased evaluations of robotics computing performance for hardware, software, and services.
Purpose Benchmarking assists in performance evaluation. Roboticists can use performance data to develop more efficient robotic systems and choose the appropriate hardware for each robotic application with the help of performance data. It can also aid in comprehending the trade-offs between algorithms implementing the same skill.
Standards RobotPerf™ aligns to robotics standards so that you don’t spend time reinventing the wheel and re-develop what already works for most. Particularly benchmarks are conducted using the as its common baseline. RobotPerf™ also aligns to standardization initiatives within the ROS ecosystem related to computing performance and benchmarking such as REP 2008 ( ). See the RobotPerf™ Specification for more details.
RobotPerf™ source code Why?
Robot behaviors take the form of computational graphs, with data flowing between computation Nodes, across physical networks (communication buses) and while mapping to underlying sensors and actuators. The popular choice to build these computational graphs for robots these days is the Robot Operating System (ROS), a framework for robot application development. ROS enables you to build computational graphs and create robot behaviors by providing libraries, a communication infrastructure, drivers and tools to put it all together. Most companies building real robots today use ROS or similar event-driven software frameworks. ROS is thereby the common language in robotics, with several hundreds of companies and thousands of developers ROS and solves many of the problems in building reliable robotics systems.
vendor solutions support, and with a variety of modular packages, each implementing a different robotics feature that simplifies performance benchmarking in robotics.

More about ROS Robotics Computing Performance: Visualizing For robotic architects, delving into the multifaceted dimensions of computing performance is crucial, yet often intricate. RobotPerf™ stands as a beacon in this space, offering a range of visualizations tailored for clarity and depth. One such illustration is the polar plot, which displays benchmarks within a particular robotic computing category on separate axes. Through RobotPerf™, architects can instantly perceive a system's proficiency across these benchmarks.
They can pinpoint both the strengths and areas of improvement, and thereby make informed decisions in design and optimization. With RobotPerf™, the complexity of robotics computing performance is transformed into actionable insights, making the architect's role not only simpler but also more effective.
Robot Benchmarks : Two benchmarking approaches GREY-BOX is an application-specific measure capable of watching internal states of the system that can measure (probe) certain points in the system, thus generate the measurement data with minimal interference incurring into a minimal average latency of only 3.3 us, making it well-suited for real-time systems. This approach is more complex, but it offers a more detailed analysis, and makes it more appealing for real-world robotic applications and real-time systems, but a less good choice for quick prototyping.
BLACK-BOX measures performance by eliminating the layers above the layer-of-interest and replacing those with a specific test application or compute node. While this approach doesn't need extra instrumentation, and is easier to implement, it offers a less detailed analysis, has limited data points, and uses a non-standard data format while altering the computational graph (introducing new nodes). This makes it less appealing for real-world robotic applications and real-time systems, but a good choice for quick prototyping.

Benchmarks Launch your ROS graphs into the cloud Supporting the top cloud service providers Hardware acceleration in the cloud for ROS Leveraging the cloud provides roboticists with unlimited resources to further accelerate computations. Besides lots of CPU, cloud computing providers such as GCP, Azure or AWS offer instances that provide big FPGAs and GPUs for on-cloud hardware acceleration. This means once the ROS graph is partially in the cloud, architects can use custom accelerators to reduce and optimize robotic computations. But tapping into all that power while aligned with common ROS and robotics development flows is non-trivial.

Acceleration Robotics | Accelerating metal part manufacturing with robots Products Collaborative Benchmarks Consulting Robot IP design Company Case studies ROS News Do you like cookies?
We use cookies to ensure you get the best experience on our website.
Accelerating metal part manufacturing with robots Heavy metallic parts are manipulated by machinery and robots with tasks involving soldering and assembly. The environment is characterized by large robots and slow-communicating large machinery and equipment, with workers overseeing the slow process. In our work with Grupo Celsa we accelerated their robotic vision pipelines by more than 62x , down to milliseconds, enabling faster robot manipulation and real-time quality control.
The challenge The traditional process of soldering and assembling heavy metallic parts is slow and labor-intensive. These parts often have unstructured surfaces, requiring robots to rely on advanced perception systems powered by computer vision for precise manipulation. The challenge lies in speeding up these perception systems to enhance robotic efficiency and enable real-time quality control.

Robot Operating System (ROS) | Acceleration Robotics Products Collaborative Benchmarks Consulting Robot IP design Company Case studies ROS News Do you like cookies?
We use cookies to ensure you get the best experience on our website.
Robot Operating System (ROS) The de facto framework for robot application development ROS is the common language roboticists use to build robots. It's an open source and modular set of software libraries and tools that help you build robot applications. It provides a message-passing system between software components, drivers for robot hardware, state-of-the-art robotic algorithms, and powerful developer tools to test, debug and visualize your robot.
Why is ROS so important?
Robots are networks of networks, with sensors capturing data, passing to compute technologies, and then on to actuators and back again in a deterministic manner. These networks can be understood as the nervous system of the robot, passing across compute Nodes , that represent neurons . Like the human nervous systems, real-time information across all these computational Nodes is fundamental for the robot to behave coherently.
"Robot brains" are built with this same philosophy. Behaviors take the form of computational graphs, with data flowing between Nodes, across physical networks (communication buses) and while mapping to underlying sensors, compute technologies and actuators.
ROS enables you to build these computational graphs and create robot behaviors by providing libraries, a communication infrastructure, drivers and tools to put it all together.
"Nearly 55% of total commercial robots shipped in 2024 will have at least one ROS package installed, creating a large installed base of ROS-enabled robots."

Other products ROBOTCORE Speed up your ROS tf ) is an optimized robotics transform library that manages efficiently the transformations between coordinate systems in a robot.
tf2 ) library , ROBOTCORE delivers higher throughput and lower latency while aligning with the standard way to keep track of coordinate frames and transform data within a ROS robotic system.
Robotics consulting?
Accelerated coordinate transformations ( tf ) The ROS tf2 library manages the transformations between coordinate systems in a robot. It does so by using a directed single rooted tree that has methods for 1) registration of transformation information and 2) computation of coordinate transformations. The cool thing about tf2 is that it allows to transform data in time as well as in space, which makes it a centric component in the ROS ecosystem being used in popular robotics stacks including navigation2 , moveit2 and Autoware.Auto .
ROBOTCORE introduces architectural upgrades in the tf2 implementation and leverages hardware acceleration to create customized transform data pipelines that deliver higher throughput and lower the latency while reading (or publishing) the tf2 tree. ROBOTCORE is served either as source code or as an IP which allows your ROS computational graphs to easily integrate it. Delivering lower latency and higher throughput , it's API-compatible with tf2 library simplifying its integration in existing robots, so that you don’t spend time reinventing the wheel and re-developing what already works.
Benchmarks Why tf2 ?
To keep track of a robot's position, and the rest of the world in relation to itself tf2 allows roboticists to keep track of multiple coordinate frames over time. It maintains the relationship between coordinate frames in a graph-like data structure (a tree) that is buffered in time, and lets the ROS graph-users to transform data between any two coordinate frames at any desired point in time, provided such point is available within the buffers.
tf2 is generally best understood via example: consider a robot fleet consisting on 3 robots in a warehouse that start from similar positions. Each robot senses the environment using the laser mounted on its top ( base_link_laser frame), as well as the lasers readings from the other robots. The challenge on each robot to integrate all these laser readings requires knowledge of the relationship over time and over space between the laser ( base_link_laser frame), to the base ( base_link frame), to the ground level ( base_footprint frame), to the world frame ( map frame) and back to whichever frame ends up being used to compute the sensor fusion. After all, sensor readings can only be integrated when expressed in the same coordinate frame.
Up to 5x faster tf2 tree operations tf2 sits at the core of navigation2 , moveit2 and Autoware.Auto (among others). For every motion computation, the tf2 tree gets accessed many times. This makes tf2 a very time-sensitive component in high performance robots, wherein both latency and throughput must be carefully considered.
That's where ROBOTCORE comes to play. It introduces architectural upgrades in the tf2 implementation and leverages hardware acceleration delivering a 5x latency speedup in coordinate transformations.
Developer-ready documentation and support is served by seasoned ROS developers and for ROS development.
It ships as a complement to ROBOTCORE either as IP, or as source code. It includes documentation, examples, reference designs and the possibility of various levels of support.

This system ensures lower and consistent communication latency, crucial for real-time robotic applications, and addresses major bottlenecks in robotic communications [1] , [2] , [3] .

Multiple Cameras for Extended Coverage.
Occlusion Handling If the Occlusion Handling (OH) variant of the control system is enabled, a Depth Grid Map is generated in the form of a file that can live either in the CPU or in the FPGA memory. The Depth Grid Map contains the mapping from one camera, the principal camera, and the other cameras introduced in the system, the secondary cameras. The principal camera's view volume is divided into a grid by dividing it into pixels (in x and y) and by a user-defined depth value in the z-axis, generating a 2.5D frustum. Each cell contains data on the pixel region and depth in which they are visible in other cameras. This mapping is then used to query the different images during the distance evaluation stage. As a result, the system can handle occlusions across cameras and provide a more accurate representation of the robot's environment, enhancing its safety and reliability while delivering the evasive behaviors required for safe human-robot collaboration.
The Control Theory Behind Depth Image-Based Robot Control Our system captures depth images of the robot and its surroundings, requiring calibration of the relative positions between the robot and the camera. The robot's geometry is filtered out, and critical distances from control points on the robot to the surrounding depth camera detections are identified.
Control points are defined using TF frames on the robot's geometry, typically on the axes connecting the joints. These points can be added by including link elements without geometry to the robot's URDF/XACRO model . The distribution of these points should ensure the entire robot is covered within the repulsive potential field's saturation region . The distance between consecutive points should generally be less than \(\left(\frac{-3}{\alpha} + 1\right) \frac{\rho}{2}\). More points increase precision but also computation time.
Based on these distances, a Cartesian repulsive vector and an attractive configuration (PID) vector are computed. These vectors are combined in joint space to obtain a velocity command . The repulsion intensity (\(v_{\text{rep}}\)) is regulated by a curve defined by \(v_{\text{max}}\), \(\rho\), \(d_{\text{min}}\), and \(\alpha\).
This velocity command is limited based on joint velocity limits from other control points and smoothed through an acceleration filter before being transmitted to the robot.
The operation of this system is as follows: A stream of depth images is captured, showing the target robot and its immediate surroundings. The relative positions between the robot and the camera must be calibrated.
The robot's geometry is filtered out from these images.
The filtered image is analyzed to identify critical distances from control points defined on the robot's geometry to the detections from the surrounding depth camera. An example of these control points for a UR10e robot can be seen in the following image. These control points are defined using TF frames located on the robot's geometry, typically on the axes connecting the joints. These points can be simply defined by adding a series of `link` elements without associated geometry to the robot's URDF/XACRO model. The process of adding/modifying these control points to the configuration of the various involved nodes and the controller will be reflected in the documentation provided with the solution code. The distribution of these points along the robot's geometry should generally be sufficient to ensure that the entire volume of the robot is covered within the saturation region of the repulsive potential field function. This function appears in the next step, but as a rule of thumb, the distance between consecutive points should generally be less than \(\left(\frac{-3}{\alpha} + 1\right) \frac{\rho}{2}\). It is worth noting that the greater the number and density of these points, the more precise the coverage of the geometry at the cost of increased computation time.
Based on these distances for the end effector control point, a Cartesian repulsive vector is computed, and based on the current goal, an attractive configuration (PID) vector is also computed. These vectors are combined in joint space to obtain a velocity command. The intensity of the repulsion (\(v_{\text{rep}}\)) is regulated by a curve defined by the attached image: Where \(v_{\text{max}}\) is the maximum Cartesian repulsion velocity, \(\rho\) is the radius around a control point where obstacles are considered, \(d_{\text{min}}\) is the minimum distance from the control point to the obstacle, and \(\alpha\) is a shape factor that regulates the slope of the curve.
This velocity command is then limited based on velocity limits for each joint computed from the other control points.
The joint command limited to these new limits is smoothed through an acceleration filter.
This smoothed command is transmitted to the robot.

Our benchmarking frame- work provides ready-to-use tools and is easily adaptable for the from the knowledge of leading robot architects and system architecture experts, RobotPerf establishes a standardized ap- proach to robotics benchmarking. As an open-source initiative, RobotPerf remains committed to evolving with community input to advance the future of hardware-accelerated robotics.
I. I NTRODUCTION In order for robotic systems to operate safely and effec- tive in dynamic real-world environments, their computations must run at real-time rates while meeting power constraints.
Towards this end, accelerating robotic kernels on heteroge- neous hardware, such as GPUs and FPGAs, is emerging as a crucial tool for enabling such performance [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7]. This is particularly important given the impending end of Moore’s Law and the end of Dennard Scaling, which limits single CPU performance [8], [9].
While hardware-accelerated kernels offer immense poten- tial, they necessitate a reliable and standardized infrastructure to be effectively integrated into robotic systems. As the industry leans more into adopting such standard software infrastructure, the Robot Operating System (ROS) [10] has emerged as a favored choice. Serving as an industry-grade middleware, it aids in building robust computational robotics graphs, reinforcing the idea that robotics is more than just in- combined with the computational improvements offered by hardware acceleration, accentuates the community’s demand for a standardized, industry-grade benchmark to evaluate var- ied hardware solutions. Recently, there has been a plethora of workshops and tutorials focusing on benchmarking robotics applications [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], 1Acceleration Robotics, Spain.2Alpen-Adria-Universit ¨at Klagenfurt, Austria.3Harvard University, USA.4Georgia Institute of Technology, USA.

In this paper, we introduce RobotPerf , an open-source and community-driven benchmarking tool designed to assess the performance of robotic computing systems in a standardized, architecture-neutral, and reproducible way, accommodating the various combinations of hardware and software in dif- ferent robotic platforms (see Figure 1). RobotPerf focuses computational graphs on a wide array of hardware setups, encompassing a complete robotics pipeline and emphasizingarXiv:2309.09212v2 [cs.RO] 29 Jan 2024 real-time critical metrics. The framework incorporates two distinct benchmarking methodologies that utilize various forms of instrumentation and ROS nodes to capture critical metrics in robotic systems. These approaches are: black-box testing, which measures performance by eliminating upper layers and replacing them with a test application, and grey- box testing, an application-specific measure that observes internal system states with minimal interference. The frame- work is user-friendly, easily extendable for evaluating custom hardware acceleration vendors for a standardized benchmark- ing approach. It aims to foster research and innovation as an open-source project. We validate the framework’s capabilities by conducting benchmarks on diverse hardware platforms, including CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs, thereby showcasing RobotPerf’s utility in drawing valuable performance insights.
RobotPerf’s source code and documentation are available athttps://github.com/robotperf/benchmarks and its methodologies are currently being used in industry to benchmark industry-strength, production-grade systems.
II. B ACKGROUND & R ELATED WORK ROS [10] is a widely-used middleware for robot devel- opment that serves as a structured communications layer and offers a comprehensive suite of additional functionalities including: open-source packages and drivers for various tasks, sensors, and actuators, as well as a collection of tools that simplify development, deployment, and debugging processes. ROS enables the creation of computational graphs (see Figure 1) that connect software processes, known as nodes, through topics, facilitating the development of end- to-end robotic systems. Within this framework, nodes can publish to or subscribe from topics, enhancing the modularity of robotic systems.
to industry Data Distribution Service (DDS) and Real-Time Data Distribution Service (DDS) standard, it enables fine- grained, direct, inter- and intra-node communication, enhanc- ing performance, reducing latency, and improving scalability.
Importantly, these improvements are also designed to support hardware acceleration [30], [5]. Over 600 companies have environments, underscoring its significance and widespread adoption in the industry [11].

ing their performance as well as a plethora of workshops and tutorials focusing on benchmarking robotics applica- tions [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22]. However, most of these robotics benchmarks focus on algorithm correctness ( functional testing) in the context of domain specific problems, as well as end-to-end latency on CPUs [31], [32], [33], [34], [37], [35], [38], [36], [39], [40], [41], [42], [43], [44], [45], [46], [47], [48]. A few works also analyze some non-functional metrics, such as CPU performance benchmarks, to explore bottleneck behaviors in selected workloads [23], [24], [49].
Recent work has also explored the implications of oper- graph performance through benchmarking [50], [51], [52], [53], [54] as well as by optimizing the scheduling and com- [57], [58], [59], [60], [61], [62]. These works often focused on a specific context or (set of) performance counter(s).
Finally, previous work has leveraged hardware acceler- ation for select ROS Nodes and adaptive computing to optimize the ROS computational graphs [63], [64], [65], [66], [67], [68], [69], [70], [71], [72], [73], [74], [75], [76], [77], [78], [79]. However, these works do not provide comprehensive frameworks to quickly analyze and evaluate new heterogeneous computational graphs except for two works that are limited to the context of UA Vs [25], [28].
Research efforts most closely related to our work include ros2 tracing [80] and RobotCore [5]. ros2 tracing provided instrumentation that demonstrated integration with illuminates the advantages of using vendor-specific tracing to complement ros2 tracing to assess the performance two specific foundational contributions, RobotPerf offers a pipeline and evaluates them on diverse hardware.
Table I summarizes our unique contributions. It includes a selection of representative benchmarks from above and provides an evaluation of these benchmarks against Robot- Perf, focusing on essential characteristics vital for robotic systems. We note that while our current approach focuses only on non-functional performance benchmarking tests, RobotPerf’s architecture and methodology can be extended to also measure functional metrics.
III. R OBOT PERF: PRINCIPLES & M ETHODOLOGY RobotPerf is an open-source, industry-strength robotics benchmark for portability across heterogeneous hardware platforms. This section outlines the important design prin- ciples and describes the implementation methodology.
A. Non-Functional Performance Testing Currently, RobotPerf specializes in non-functional perfor- mance testing, evaluating the efficiency and operational char- acteristics of robotic systems. Non-functional performance testing measures those aspects not belonging to the system’s functions, such as computational latency, memory consump- tion, and CPU usage. In contrast, traditional functional performance testing looks into the system’s specific tasks and function, verifying its effectiveness in its primary goals, like the accuracy of the control algorithm in following a planned robot’s path. While functional testing confirms a system performs its designated tasks correctly, non-functional testing ensures it operates efficiently and reliably.
computational graphs, rather than focusing on independent for the easy composition of complex robotic systems. This makes the benchmark versatile and well-suited for a wide range of robotic applications and enables industry, which is widely using ROS, to rapidly adopt RobotPerf.
C. Platform Independence & Portability RobotPerf allows for the evaluation of benchmarks on a variety of hardware platforms, including general-purpose CPUs and GPUs, reconfigurable FPGAs, and specialized ac- celerators (e.g., ray tracing accelerators [81]). Benchmarking robotic workloads on heterogeneous platforms is vital to evaluate their respective capabilities and limitations. This fa- cilitates optimizations for efficiency, speed, and adaptability, as well as fine-tuning of resource allocations, ensuring robust and responsive operation across diverse contexts.
D. Flexible Methodology We offer grey-box and black-box testing methods to suit different needs. Black-box testing provides a quick-to-enable external perspective and measures performance by eliminat- ing the layers above the layer-of-interest and replacing thoseCRITERIA Grey-Box Black-Box PRECISION Utilizes tracers from in- sage subscriptions.
PERFORMANCE Low overhead. Driven by sage callbacks. Recorded by userspace processes.
FLEXIBILITY Multiple event types. Limited to message sub- scriptions in current im- plementation.
PORTABILITY Requires a valid tracer.
Custom JSON format.
EASE OF USE Requires code modifica- tions and data postpro- cessing.Tests unmodified soft- ware with minor node additions.

with a specific test application. Grey-box testing provides more granularity and dives deeper into the internal workings ments at the cost of increased engineering effort. As such, each method has its trade-offs, and providing both options enables users flexibility. We describe each method in more detail below and highlight takeaways in Table II.
1) Grey-Box Testing: Grey-box testing enables precise probe placement within a robot’s computational graph, gen- erating a chronologically ordered log of critical events using a tracer that could be proprietary or open source, such as LTTng [82]. As this approach is fully integrated with incurs a minimal average latency of only 3.3 µ s[80], making it well-suited for real-time systems. With this approach, optionally, RobotPerf offers specialized input and output nodes that are positioned outside the nodes of interest to avoid the need to instrument them. These nodes generate the message tracepoints upon publish and subscribe events which are processed to calculate end-to-end latency.
2) Black-Box Testing: The black-box methodology uti- lizes a user-level node called the MonitorNode to evaluate scribes to the target node, recording the timestamp when each message is received. By accessing the propagated ID, the MonitorNode determines the end-to-end latency by com- paring its timestamp against the PlaybackNode ’s recorded timestamp for each message. While this approach does not need extra instrumentation, and is easier to implement, it offers a less detailed analysis and alters the computational graph by introducing new nodes and dataflow.
E. Opaque Performance Tests The requirement for packages to be instrumented directly within the source code poses a challenge to many bench- marking efforts. To overcome this hurdle, for most bench- marks, we refrain from altering the workloads of interest and, instead, utilize specialized input and output nodes positioned outside the primary nodes of concern. This setup allows for benchmarking without the need for direct instrumentation of Category Benchmark Name Description a2rectify rectify component [83], [84].

the target layer. We term this methodology “opaque tests,” a concept that RobotPerf adheres to when possible.
F . Reproducibility & Consistency To ensure consistent and reproducible evaluations, Robot- Perf adheres to specific common robotic dataformats. In par- athttps://github.com/robotperf/rosbags , as well third-party bags (e.g., the r2b dataset [99]).
To ensure consistent data loading and finer control over message delivery rates, we drew inspiration from [100].
Our computational graphs incorporate modified and im- proved DataLoaderNode andPlaybackNode imple- mentations, which can be accessed at https://github .com/robotperf/ros2_benchmark . These enhanced nodes offer improvements that report worst-case latency and enable the reporting of maximum latency, introduce the ability to profile power consumption and so forth.
G. Metrics We focus on three key metrics: latency, throughput and power consumption including energy efficiency. Latency measures the time between the start and the completion of a task. Throughput measures the total amount of work done in a given time for a task. Power measures the electrical energy per unit of time consumed while executing a given task. Measuring energy efficiency (or performance-per-Watt) captures the total amount of work (relative to either through- put or latency) that can be delivered for every watt of power consumed and is directly related to the runtime of battery powered robots [25].
H. Current Benchmarks and Categories RobotPerf beta [98] introduces benchmarks that cover the robotics pipeline from perception, to localization, tocontrol, as well as dedicated benchmarks for manipulation.
The full list of benchmarks in the beta release can be found in Table III. Aligned with our principles defined above, describes all dependencies (generally other ROS packages).
To facilitate reproducibility, all benchmarks are designed to flows ( ament build tools, colcon meta-build tools, etc.).
Finally, so that the benchmarks can be easily consumed by other tools, a description of each benchmark, as well as its results, is defined in a machine-readable format. As such, accompanying the package.xml andCMakeLists.txt files required for all ROS packages, a YAML file named benchmark.yaml is in the root of each benchmark which describes the benchmark and includes accepted results.
I. Run Rules To ensure the reliability and reproducibility of the perfor- mance data, we adhere to a stringent set of run rules. First, tests are performed in a controlled environment to ensure that performance data is not compromised by fluctuating external parameters. As per best practices recommended by ros2 tracing [80], we record and report settings like clock frequency and core count. Second, we look forward to the possibility of RobotPerf being embraced by the community and have results undergo peer review, which can contribute to enhancing reproducibility and accuracy. Finally, we aim to avoid overfitting to specific hardware setups or software configurations by encompassing a broad spectrum of test scenarios.
IV. E VALUATION We conduct comprehensive benchmarking using Robot- Perf to evaluate its capabilities on three key aspects vital for a robotics-focused computing benchmark. First, we validate the framework’s capacity to provide comparative insights across divergent heterogeneous platforms from edge devices to server-class hardware. Second, we analyze the results to understand RobotPerf’s ability to guide selection of the optimal hardware solution tailored to particular robotic work- loads. Finally, we assess how effectively RobotPerf reveals the advantages conferred by hardware and software acceler- ation techniques relative to general-purpose alternatives. All of our results and source code can be found open-source at: https://github.com/robotperf/benchmarks .
A. Fair and Representative Assessment of Heterogeneity Assessing hardware heterogeneity in robotic applications is imperative in the ever-evolving field of robotics. Different robotic workloads demand varying computational resources and efficiency levels. Therefore, comprehensively evaluating performance across diverse hardware platforms is crucial.
We evaluated the RobotPerf benchmarks over a wide list of hardware platforms, including general-purpose CPUs on edge devices (e.g., Qualcomm RB5), server-class CPUs (e.g., Intel i7-8700), and specialized hardware accelerators (e.g., AMD Kria KR260). Figure 3 illustrates benchmark performance in robotics per category of workload (percep- tion, localization, control, and manipulation) using radar plots, wherein the different hardware solutions are depicted together alongside different robotic workloads per category.
Each hardware solution is presented with a different color, with smaller values and areas representing better perfor- mance in the respective category. Given our ability to benchmark 18 platforms (bottom of Figure 3), RobotPerf is capable of benchmarking heterogeneous hardware platforms and workloads, paving the way for community-driven co- design and optimization of hardware and software.
B. Quantitative Approach to Hardware Selection The rapid evolution and diversity of tasks in robotics means we need to have a meticulous and context-specific ap- proach to computing hardware selection and optimization. A “one-size-fits-all” hardware strategy would be an easy default selection, but it fails to capitalize on the nuanced differences in workload demands across diverse facets like perception, localization, control, and manipulation, each exhibiting dis- tinctive sensitivities to hardware capabilities. Therefore, a rigorous analysis, guided by tools like RobotPerf, becomes essential to pinpoint the most effective hardware configura- tions that align well with individual workload requirements.
The results in Figure 3 demonstrate the fallacy of a “one- size-fits-all” solution. For example, focusing in on the latency radar plot for control from Figure 3 (col 3, row 1), we see that the i7-12700H (I7H) outperforms the NVIDIA AGX Orin Dev. Kit (NO) on benchmarks C1,C3,C4, and C5, but is 6.5×slower on benchmark C2. As such, by analyzing data from the RobotPerf benchmarks, roboticists can better determine which hardware option best suits their needs given their specific workloads and performance requirements.
One general lesson learned while evaluating the data is that each workload is unique, making it hard to general- 3.3x 4.4x 11.5xFig. 2: Benchmark comparison of perception latency (ms) on AMD’s Kria KR260 with and without the ROBOTCORE a5as defined in Table III. We find that hardware acceleration can enable performance gains of as much as 11.5 ×.
ize across both benchmarks and categories. To that end, RobotPerf results help us understand how the use of various hardware solutions and dedicated domain-specific hardware accelerators significantly improves the performance.
C. Rigorous Assessment of Acceleration Benefits In the rapidly advancing field of computing hardware, the optimization of algorithm implementations is a crucial factor in determining the success and efficiency of robotic applications. The need for an analytical tool, like RobotPerf, that facilitates the comparison of various algorithmic imple- mentations on uniform hardware setups becomes important.
Figure 2 is a simplified version of Figure 3, depicting AMD’s Kria KR260 hardware solution in two forms: the usual hardware and a variant that leverages a domain- soft-core running in the FPGA for accelerating perception robotic computations). The figure demonstrates that hardware acceleration can enable performance gains of as much as 11.5×(from 173 ms down to 15 ms for benchmark a5). We stress that the results obtained here should be interpreted according to each end application and do not represent a generic recommendation on which hardware should be used.
Other factors, including availability, the form factor, and community support, are relevant aspects to consider when selecting a hardware solution.
V. C ONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK RobotPerf represents an important step towards stan- dardized benchmarking in robotics. With its comprehensive evaluation across the hardware/software stack and focus on way for rigorous co-design of robotic hardware and algo- rithms. As RobotPerf matures with community involvement, we expect it to compare CPU, GPU and FPGA, exploring their power consumption and flexibility in augmenting real- world robotic computations. With a standardized robotics benchmark as a focal point, the field can make rapid progress in delivering real-time capable systems that will unlock the true potential of robotics in real-world applications.

Radar plots illustrate the latency, throughput, and power consumption for each hardware solution and workload, with reported values representing the maximum across a series of runs. The labels of vertices represent the workloads defined in Table III. Each hardware platform and performance testing procedure is delineated by a separate color, with darker colors representing Black-box testing and lighter colors Grey-box testing. In the figure’s key, the hardware platforms are categorized into four specific types: general-purpose hardware, heterogeneous hardware, reconfigurable hardware, and accelerator hardware. Within each category, the platforms are ranked based on their Thermal Design Power (TDP), which indicates the maximum power they can draw under load. The throughput values for manipulation tasks and power values for localization tasks have not been incorporated into the beta version of RobotPerf.
As RobotPerf continues to evolve, more results will be added in subsequent iterations.

Meeting time deadlines in their computations (real-time) is the most important feature however other characteristics are also of relevance while designing robotic computations including the time between the start and the completion of a task (latency), the total amount of work done in a given time (bandwidth or throughput) or that a task happens in exactly the same timeframe, each time (determinism). CPUs are widely used in robotics due to their availability however they hardly provide real-time and safety guarantees while delivering high throughput. Hardware acceleration ( with either FPGAs, GPUs or other accelerators) presents an answer to this problem. One that allows the robotics architect to create custom computing architectures for robots that comply with real-time and bandwidth requirements, while lowering power consumption.
Hardware acceleration has the potential to revolutionize robotics, enabling new applications by speeding up robot response times while remaining power-efficient. However, the diversity of acceleration options makes it difficult for roboticists to select the right computational resource for each task. This report captures the state-of-the art of hardware acceleration in robotics by following a quantitative approach and presents robotic architects with a resource to consider while designing their robot computational architectures. The report compares the most popular computation solutions in robotics used today through reproducible and Acceleration Working Group GitHub organization.
Since most companies building real robots today use ROS or similar event-driven software frameworks, this report uses ROS as the common baseline in robotics to conduct the study (section 2.2). In particular, we framework for robot application development and consider both bandwidth and latency to benchmark performance in robotics (section 2.3) using a grey-box and non-functional benchmarking approach (section 2.4).
9 Hardware Acceleration Report in Robotics2022 The work presented in this report happened in two phases. First, a community survey conducted in both the ROS and the overall robotics communities helped grasp the interest behind the use of hardware acceleration in robotics.
Input from this community survey was then used to drive the second phase, a hardware acceleration benchmarking effort. The most relevant results from these two phases are summarized below: Community Survey Only about half of the respondents (51%, section 3 .1 ) is confident about the value and differences between hardware acceleration solutions for robotics: Only 62.5% (section 3.2) have ever programmed an acceleration kernel.
This suggests that there’s still a lot of work to be done from silicon vendors’ side to further simplify the use and integration of their solutions.
The majority of the roboticists currently use GPUs (69.8%, section 3. 11) versus FPGAs (21.9%): Roboticists seem to care about speed or latency (48.9%, shorter execution time) as much as real-time and determinism (46.8%). Only a reduced 4.3% would prioritize power consumption (section 3. 10).
This indicates that there’s margin for FPGA usage growth in the ROS robotics community .
When asked about the most relevant aspects of hardware acceleration (section 3.3), 52. 1% of the roboticists that and its ecosystem of tools is of most relevance to them: 11.5%, colcon build tools 19.8% and acceleration firmware 20.8%).

10Results obtained across benchmarks performed on a of view optimized FPGA accelerators outperform their GPU counterparts, even when using powerful GPUs.
Considering mean runtime measurements (in ms, Figure 15, section 4.2), the use of a CPU + FPGA combination delivers a 3.56x speedup over a comparable CPU + GPU, and a 1.36x speedup over a comparable CPU.
When considering a more powerful CPU + GPU combination (Figure 17 , section 4.2), the FPGA still outperforms it with a 1.59x speedup.
outperform those running in a GPU by relevant speedups.
T o discriminate between any possible differences between the CPU cores, measurements were collected isolating perception computations by infrastructure overhead, as well as the host-device (GPU or FPGA) data transfer overhead.
Popular perception algorithms such as the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) show a 500x speedup in an FPGA and relative to a comparable GPU (Figure 22).Benchmarking hardware acceleration 11 Hardware Acceleration Report in Robotics2022 11Figure 0 Performance-per- watt benchmark perception graph across various accelerators. The computational graph studied is described in section 4.2.
2.5 2 1.5 1 0.5 0 CPU + FPGA (KR260) CPU + FPGA ( Jetson Nano)CPU + GPU ( Jetson AGX Xavier) Overall, results hint that the rate at which the energy consumption grows with GPU solutions seems to be smaller than the rate at which the latency performance improves, which leads to a decaying performance-per- GPU + CPU solutions. Instead, FPGA-enabled solutions present a performance-per-watt figure that’s 6x ( 5.93x) better than the one observed in comparable GPU + CPU sets and 8x (7 .95x) better than the one in more power GPU + CPU sets.
These results indicate that using bandwidth as the only measure of performance can be misleading in ROS and robotics. Moreover, data suggests that when considering latency as the measure of performance, GPU sets may struggle to find themselves on equal footing with their FPGA counterparts.
There are nevertheless various advantages that GPUs inherently have and that should be considered while building complex robotic computations. Moreover, though FPGA kernel runtime execution outperforms their GPU counterparts, it’s relevant to note that FPGAs are resource-limited and thereby it’s important to consider that only a fixed set of accelerators would be able to fit within an FPGA at any given point in time whereas the GPUs don’t have this limitation due to their architectures.
Scalable robot compute architectures that consider hardware acceleration should look at combining CPUs, GPUs and FPGAs to obtain the best trade-off.
12 Hardware Acceleration Report in Robotics2022 13 Introduction 14The CPU whack-a-mole in robotics Robots are deterministic machines. Meeting time deadlines in their computations (real-time) is the most important feature however other characteristics are also of relevance while designing robotic computations including the time between the start and the completion of a task (latency), the total amount of work done in a given time (bandwidth or throughput) or that a task happens in exactly the same timeframe, each time (determinism).
There’s a critical relationship between the hardware and the software capabilities in a robot. Robotic systems usually have limited on-board resources, including memory , I/O, disk or compute capabilities, making it hard to balance between real-time and bandwidth requirements ( due to limited shared resources), and restricting robots’ reaction capabilities and speed. A key challenge in robotics using general purpose CPUs1 is that they hardly provide real-time and safety guarantees while delivering high throughput. The de facto strategy in industry [1 ] to meet timing deadlines is a laborious, empirical, and case-by-case tuning of the system. This “CPU whack-a-mole” approach in robotics is unsustainable and hard to scale due to the lack of a hardware-supported timing-safe event driven programming interface in CPUs.CPUs hardly provide real-time and safety guarantees while delivering high throughput.
This “CPU whack- a-mole” approach in robotics is unsustainable and hard to scale1 CPUs are widely used in commercial compute platforms in robotics due to their availability and generalized use. The general purpose nature of CPUs makes them specially interesting for roboticists to kickstart projects, however this comes at a cost when translating into real applications: their fixed architectures and limited amount of resources difficult adaptability to new ( computing) robotic scenarios and always impose a trade-off between performance and determinism.2 .1 15 Hardware Acceleration Report in Robotics2022 Hardware acceleration with dedicated compute architectures (in either FPGAs, GPUs or other accelerators) is presented as an alternative to CPUs.
One that allows the architect to adaptively generate custom computing architectures to meet the robotic computing demands, delivering a solution that can comply with real-time and bandwidth requirements while increasing reliability and lowering power consumption. Hardware acceleration is presented as an alternative to CPUs delivering a solution that can comply with real-time and bandwidth requirementsThis report presents robotic architects with a resource to consider while designing their robot computational architectures that describes how hardware acceleration can improve their performance. T o study the capabilities of hardware acceleration in robotics, this article follows a quantitative approach [2] to measure performance and compares the most popular hardware Results presented in this report are meant to be reproducible and disclosed as open source examples Acceleration Working Group GitHub organization repositories.
baseline in robotics Robot behaviors take the form of computational graphs, with data flowing between computation Nodes, across physical networks ( communication buses) and while mapping to underlying sensors and actuators. The popular choice to build these computational graphs for robots these days is the Robot Operating System (ROS) [3], a framework for robot application development. ROS enables you to build computational graphs and create robot behaviors by providing libraries, a communication infrastructure, drivers and tools to put it all together. Most companies building real robots today use ROS or similar event-driven software frameworks. ROS is thereby the common language in robotics, with several hundreds of companies and thousands of developers using it to address some of the challenges in ROS and solves many of the problems in building reliable robotics systems.
robot application development most silicon vendor solutions support, and with a variety of modular packages, each implementing a different robotics feature that simplifies performance benchmarking in robotics.2.2 17 Hardware Acceleration Report in Robotics2022 Bandwidth, latency and performance considerations The field of robotics is changing rapidly and must be studied with real examples and measurements on real robotic computations, rather than simply as a collection of definitions, designs and marketing actions. The quantitative approach [2] to robotics systems architecture fits well in this context and helps robotic architects come up with better performing architectures through an empirical strategy , and case-by-case tuning of the system.
In robotics bandwidth or throughput is the total amount of work done in a given time, such as the publication feed resulting from processing the data of a camera, or the second) of a processed point cloud coming from a depth sensor. In contrast, latency or response time is the time between the start and the completion of a task, such as T opic subscription in a computational graph.
When speaking about performance in robotics, both bandwidth and latency should be taken into consideration. In particular, given the importance of real- time in robotics we’ d generally be interested in the latency for performance benchmarking. 2.3 A final consideration is the bandwidth/latency performance improvement ratio in robotics. A simple rule of thumb in ( general) computation is that bandwidth grows by at least the square of the improvement in latency. Robotic architects should take this into consideration while designing their robotic systems.When speaking about performance in robotics, both bandwidth and latency should be taken in consideration 18Methodology for benchmarking performance Benchmarking is the act of running a computer program to assess its relative performance. In the context of hardware acceleration, it’s fundamental to assess the relative performance of an acceleration kernel versus its CPU scalar computing baseline. Similarly , benchmarking helps comparing acceleration kernels across hardware acceleration technology solutions ( e.g. FPGA_A vs FPGA_B or FPGA_A vs GPU_A, etc.) and across kernel implementations ( within the same hardware acceleration technology solution).
There’re different types of benchmarking approaches. The following diagram depicts the most popular inspired by [5] : Figure 1 Performance benchmarking approaches.

2 and its computational graph. If necessary , they should instrument the communications middleware and its underlying layers.
Intra-process, inter-process and intra-network: Measures conducted should consider communication within a process in the same SoC, between processes in an SoC and between different SoCs connected in the same network (intra-network).
Compute substrate-agnostic: benchmarks should be able to run on different hardware acceleration technology solutions. For that purpose, a CPU-centric framework (as opposed to an acceleration technology-specific framework) that can be integrated in various accelerators for benchmarking and/or tracing is the ideal choice.
Automated: benchmarks and related source code should be designed with automation in mind. Once ready , creating a benchmark and producing results should be (ideally ) a fully automated process.
Hardware farm mindset: benchmarks will be conducted on hardware embedded platforms sitting in a farm-like environment (redundancy of tests, multiple SoCs/boards) with the intent of validating and comparing different technologies.
Accounting for all of this, and similar to the ROS Enhancement Proposal (REP) REP-2008 proposal [6 ] , in this report we adopt a grey-box and non-functional benchmarking approach for hardware acceleration that allows to evaluate the relative complete computational graphs. T o realize it in a technology agnostic-manner, we select the Linux T racing T oolkit next generation (L TT ng) which will be used for tracing and benchmarking.Differences between tracing and benchmarking T racing and benchmarking can be better understood as follows: T racing: a technique used to understand what goes on in a running software system.
Benchmarking: a method of comparing the performance of various systems by running a common test.
From these definitions, inherently one can determine that both benchmarking and tracing are connected in the sense that the test/benchmark will use a series of measurements for comparison.
These measurements will come from tracing probes. In other words, tracing will collect data that will then be fed into a benchmark program for comparison.2 .4.1 20 Hardware Acceleration Report in Robotics2022 21 Community Survey 22Are you familiar with the different hardware acceleration solutions and their advantages (e.g. FPGAs vs GPUs) 96 answers 46,9% 51%3.1 Figure 2 Results from the “Hardware acceleration in survey” (link) question: “ Are you familiar with the different hardware acceleration solutions and their advantages Gazebo?

Binaries for plug and play for users with common hardware, but source for custom projects and memory hardware constrains Binaries would be fine but there are always corner cases when reading the source code may give you a hint on whats is going wrong. Not sure if I will spend time building it but having the code available is useful for keeping track of things Not sure if the other 3 bullets on this answer cover what I’ d like to see. I want binaries for the “common” use cases - say ...a semantic segmentation module of YOLOvX and a module of ResNet-50 + Mask R-CNN + FPN. That way , I can grab something from the single-shot detector and 2-stage detection schemes for quick inclusion in a system. But I want the source code when I look to implement my own accelerated system. In which case, I’ d like to be able to test the source and see it run just like the ResNet binary , such that I can start making the changes I need 30What do you care more about when it comes to hardware acceleration?

38Robotics perception helps sense the static and dynamic objects, and build a reliable and detailed representation of the robot’s environment using computer vision and machine learning techniques. Data obtained in a robot from its sensors like cameras and LIDAR is typically fed into the perception layer turning into something useful for decision making and planning physical actions. The perception layer in a robot is thereby responsible for object detection, segmentation and tracking. T raditionally , a perception pipeline starts with image pre-processing, followed by a region of interest detector and then a classifier that outputs (Components more specifically ) that can be used to build perception pipelines easily .Case study: Hardware subsections will follow the methodology described in section 2.4.

With plenty of attendance in each one of its meetings12 and with the participation of multiple silicon vendors, the group is arguably one of the most active ones in the ROS robotics domain.
Hardware Acceleration Working Group during 2021 and 2022 suggests that there’s an increasingly evident interest in the use of hardware acceleration solutions in robotics and 2022 suggests that there’s an increasingly evident interest in the use of hardware acceleration solutions in robotics, however, the community survey conducted hints that only about half of the respondents (51%, section 3 .1) is confident about the value and differences between hardware (section 3.2) have ever programmed an acceleration kernel, the majority of which used NVIDIA CUDA ( 80.3%, section 3.4). This suggests that there’s still a lot of work to be done from silicon vendors’ side to further simplify the use and integration of their solutions in the ROS robotics ecosystem and provide comprehensive documentation. The previous statement is confirmed by section 3.3 which highlights what aspects of hardware acceleration are of most relevance to roboticists using ROS. Unsurprisingly , we find that more than half of the respondents ( 52. 1%) indicate that a simpler integration with ROS 2 and its ecosystem of tools is of most relevance to them: tools 19.8% and acceleration firmware 20.8%) 32.3% - Capabilities to easily switch between hardware accelerated and CPU-centric Nodes 11.5% - Benchmarking capabilities for hardware acceleration 4. 1% - Others12 See https: // github.

55 Hardware Acceleration Report in Robotics2022 When looking at which packages or components of ROS 2 and Gazebo roboticists would like to accelerate first (section 3.5, multiple selections allowed), we find that demanded group of packages to be accelerated. This is closely followed by “Gazebo physics engines’’ ( 60.4%), navigation2 ( 40.6%), “DDS communication middleware” These numbers are also confirmed by individual answers provided in sections 3.6 and 3 . 7.
The majority of the respondents (92.7%) indicated that they’d prefer the commercially friendly Apache 2.0 license for hardware acceleration resources and libraries (section 3.8). When asked about the format of acceleration kernels, opposed to 18.9% which would be fine with just binaries, 74.8% would prefer source code access to acceleration kernels with code examples (section 3.9).
One surprising aspect encountered while conducting the survey is that roboticists seem to care about speed or latency ( 48.9%, shorter execution time) as much as real-time and determinism ( 46.8%). Only a reduced 4.3% would prioritize power consumption as indicated in section 3. 10. This is somewhat counter-intuitive when looking at how the majority of the roboticists currently use GPUs (69.8%, section 3. 11) versus FPGAs (21.9%), since after all, it’s widely accepted that FPGAs outperform GPUs and CPUs while delivering real-time and determinism in computations, and with lower power consumption. T o add to this conflict, section 3. 14 hints that hardware acceleration is mostly used to create battery-powered robots (and thereby power-sensitive) with roboticists creating autonomous mobile robots (AMRs, 36.4%) followed by drones ( 19.8%), industrial robotic arms ( 12.5%) and legged robots ( 5.2%).
This indicates that there’s margin for FPGA usage growth in the ROS robotics community.
The numbers of type of accelerator usage (section 3. 11) are coherent with the most popular commercial solutions (section 3. 13) with NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier being the leading solution (33.3%) followed by both the NVIDIA Jetson Nano ( 15.6%) and the AMD’s Zynq UltraScale embedded portfolio ( 15.6%, including Kria® boards).
Roboticists seem to care about speed or latency ( 48.9%, shorter execution time) as much as real-time and determinism ( 46.8%) Finally , Ubuntu seems to be the dominant (79.5%, section 3. 15) operating system requested by ROS roboticists for hardware acceleration. Ubuntu 20.04 is the preferred option ( 59%) versus Ubuntu 22.04 (20.5%). Y octo- based rootfs are the second most popular choice with 7 .7% of the respondents preferring it. As for packaging mechanisms, .deb files are the preferred option ( 59%, section 3. 16) followed by Docker containers (23. 1%).There’s still a lot of work to be done from silicon vendors’ side to further simplify the use and integration of their solutions in the ROS robotics ecosystem 56The results obtained across benchmarks performed on a simple pre- (time between the start and the completion of a task) show that optimized FPGA accelerators outperform their GPU counterparts, even when using powerful GPUs. Considering mean runtime measurements (in ms, Figure 15, section 4.2), the use of CPU + FPGA13 deliver a 3.56x speedup over a comparable CPU + GPU14, and a 1.36x speedup over a comparable CPU15.
When considering a more powerful CPU + GPU16 combination (Figure 17 , section 4.2), the FPGA still outperforms it with a 1.59x speedup.
T o further study these results and to discriminate between any possible differences between the two CPUs used (A53 cores in KR260 and the A57 passing infrastructure overhead and reports on the perception computations in the graph. Results show how perception computations in the FPGA have a 4.27x speedup relative to their GPU counterparts when running in the Jetson Nano.
Latency results obtained across benchmarks performed on show that optimized FPGA accelerators outperform their GPU counterparts, even when using powerful GPUs Performance improvements in the form of latency with dedicated acceleration kernels in FPGAs are further evident when considering the power domain.

2.5 2 1.5 1 0.5 0 CPU + FPGA (KR260) CPU + FPGA ( Jetson Nano)CPU + GPU 57 Hardware Acceleration perception graph, we observe that the FPGA designs are much more power efficient than their GPU counterparts. The KR260 presents a performance-per- watt figure that's 6x ( 5.93x) better than the one in the Jetson Nano and 8x (7 .95x) better than the one in the Jetson AGX Xavier. An interesting observation can be made here comparing the performance-per-watt results obtained from the Jetson Nano and the Jetson AGX Xavier: the Xavier features a more powerful CPU and GPU, which consumes more energy while performing computations, however the latency performance of these computations do not scale in the same manner as the energy consumption. What these results hint is that the rate at which the energy consumption grows with NVIDIA Jetson (CPU + GPU) solutions seems to be smaller than the rate at which the latency performance improves, which leads to a decaying performance- statement links back to the rule of thumb shared in section 2.3 that emphasized how “bandwidth grows by at least the square of the improvement in latency” .
With GPUs often focusing on bandwidth to measure performance, when considering latency as the measure of performance GPUs struggle to find themselves on equal footing with their FPGA counterparts.
The rate at which the energy consumption grows with NVIDIA Jetson (CPU + GPU) solutions seems to be smaller than the rate at which the latency performance improves, which leads to a decaying performance- per-watt in our measurementsThere are nevertheless various advantages that GPUs inherently have and that should be considered while building complex robotic computations. Moreover, though FPGA kernel runtime execution outperforms their GPU counterparts, it’s relevant to note that FPGAs are resource-limited and thereby it’s important to consider that only a fixed set of accelerators would be able to fit within an FPGA at any given point in time whereas the GPUs don’t have this limitation due to their architectures.
Section 4.3 further dives into this and focuses on studying while estimating resources required in an FPGA. T o do so, it isolates perception computations by discarding both as well as the host-device (GPU or FPGA) data transfer overhead. Results depicted over figures 18-33 indicate that those running in a GPU by relevant speedups. All the way up to 500x (Figure 22) in popular perception algorithms running in an FPGA outperform those running in a GPU by relevant speedups. All the way up to 500x in popular perception algorithms such as the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) 58 Hardware Acceleration Report in Robotics2022 59 Hardware Acceleration solutions for the robotics architect Acceleration Robotics is amongst the top experts globally on the Robot Operating System (ROS), hardware acceleration efforts are accelerator-agnostic (FPGAs or GPUs) and robot-agnostic.

Other products ROBOTCORE Speed up your ROS robotics perception pipelines is an optimized robotic perception stack that leverages hardware acceleration to provide a speedup in your perception computations.
, delivers high performance, real-time and reliability to your robots' perception.
Accelerated robotics perception Data obtained in a robot from its sensors like cameras and lidar is typically fed into the perception the static and dynamic objects, and build a reliable and detailed representation of the robot's environment using computer vision and machine learning techniques. The perception layer in a robot is thereby responsible for object detection, segmentation and tracking . Traditionally, a perception pipeline starts with image pre-processing, followed by a region of interest detector and then a classifier that outputs detected objects.
is a hardware accelerated perception stack served as either source code or IP that allows your perception pipelines to reduce their runtime latency and increase throughput. Delivering a perception speedup , it's API-compatible with simplifying its integration in existing robots, so that you don't spend time reinventing the wheel and re-developing what already works.
Benchmarks Default ROS perception 0.7 Hz/image for a 3-Node perception pipeline in embedded A simple Rectify-Resize-Harris ROS perception pipeline is demonstrated which performs pre-processing ( Rectify and Resize ) and region of interest detection ( Harris corners detector). This simple pipeline consisting of only 3 ROS Nodes takes on average 1266.32 milliseconds to execute for a single pass, which leads to less than 1 Hz when running in an idle embedded Quad-core arm Cortex-A53.
ROBOTCORE 4.5x speedup in simple ROS perception pipelines Faster robots require faster perception.
delivers exactly this upgrading perception pipelines with a 4.5x speedup, impacting pipeline runtime and throughput in embedded. More complex perception graphs can further leverage acceleration, achieving 10x speedups and above.
Towards more capable robots Moving faster (or with more dexterity) requires faster perception computations. Edge perception is key to navigate under environments that change, which are most in the human world. The robot below is generating information from its sensors which needs to be processed at the edge (directly in the robot) for smooth behaviors, reducing any latency from the sensors and all the way into the actuators. By leveraging hardware acceleration, robots’ perception extracts information from these sensor readings which is then used to plan actions in the order of tenths of milliseconds. All happening on the edge and responding to environmental changes.
delivers faster perception capabilities to ROS computational graphs. So that your robots can move faster and better.

Other products ROBOTCORE FPGA and GPU hardware acceleration framework for ROS helps build custom compute architectures for robots , or IP cores , directly from ROS workspaces without complex third-party tool integrations. Make your robots faster, more deterministic and/or power-efficient. Simply put, it provides a vendor-agnostic development, build and deployment experience for creating robot hardware and hardware accelerators similar to the standard, non-accelerated ROS development flow.
Read the paper How does it work?
Traditional software development in robotics is about building dataflows with ROS computational graphs. These dataflows go from sensors to compute technologies, all the way down to actuators and back, representing the "brain" of the robot. Generally, ROS computational graphs are built in the CPUs of a given robot. But CPUs have fixed hardware, with pre-defined memory architectures and constraints which limit the performance. Sparked by the decline of Moore's Law and Dennard Scaling, specialized computing units capable of hardware acceleration have proven to be the answer for achieving higher performance in robotics.
allows to easily leverage FPGA and GPU hardware acceleration in a ROS-centric manner and build custom compute architectures for robots, or " IP cores ".
With these IP cores, roboticists can adapt one or simultaneously more of the properties of their computational graphs (e.g., its speed, determinism, power consumption) optimizing the amount of hardware resources and, as a consequence, the performance in an accelerated dataflow .

Accelerating industrial legacy robot manipulation TEKNIA, an auto parts manufacturer, wanted to speed up their existing robots for faster production cycles. We collaborated to achieve first a 16.21% increase in robot movement speed by introducing variations of the robot trajectories, velocities and accelerations, and later, on a second stage a 10.78% decrease in cycle time via double-manipulation. Leveraging modern techniques, we pushed the boundaries of the robot's velocity and acceleration with optimized machine-robot interactions and movements (paths and speed), ensuring efficient movement paths with minimal wasted motions. These improvements empowered TEKNIA to produce an additional 800 units per day and over 20,000 units per month.
The challenge Metallic tubes are manufactured in a continuous process, while going through various stages of production. A robot is used to manipulate the tubes and move them from one stage to another. The robot's speed and acceleration are limiting factors in the production cycle.

We considered the various possibilities, involving the various involved machines, a faster-moving robot, and also multiple robots. We then used this model to determine the optimal combination of the interactions between the robots and the connected machines in the automation line.
Modeling the time-series We modeled the time-series of the robot movements and the machine interactions to optimize the cycle time of the automation line. This allowed us to determine the optimal combination of the interactions between the robots and the connected machines in the automation line.
Digital twin-driven validation We used digital twins to co-develop and validate the optimal time-series model. This allowed us to simulate the robot movements and the machine interactions in a virtual environment, ensuring the optimal cycle time of the automation line.
Reducing the reality gap in digital twins We reduced the reality gap in the digital twin which allowed us for faster iterations between the real world and the digital twin. This enabled us to optimize the robot movement speed for real-world performance.

Result 1: 16.21% faster robot movement On a first iteration, we achieved a 16.21% increase in robot movement speed by means of modifying trajectories and movements (velocities and accelerations), enabling TEKNIA to speed up their production cycles and increase their manufacturing capacity.
Your browser does not support the video tag.
Result 2: 10.78% faster with dual manipulation We were further challenged to increase the productivity, so we proposed a dual manipulation system. This system allowed for synchronous multi-robot trajectory coordination leading to a 10.78% increase in the manufacturing cycle time.

The popular choice to build computational graphs for robots these days is the Robot Operating System (ROS), a framework for robot application development . Most companies building real robots today use ROS (or similar event-driven software frameworks, often in concert with ROS). ROS is thereby the common language in robotics with hundreds of companies and thousands of developers using it everyday.

We use cookies to ensure you get the best experience on our website.
RobotPerf Benchmarks The benchmarking suite to evaluate robotics computing performance RobotPerf™ provides an open reference benchmarking suite that is used to evaluate robotics , so that robotic architects can make informed decisions about the hardware and software components of their robotic systems.
RobotPerf™ source code RobotPerf™ reports Robot computations can improve when the right computing platform is selected Benchmarking is the act of running a computer program with a known workload to assess the program's relative performance. Performance information can help roboticists design more efficient robotic systems and select the right hardware for their robotic application.
The performance benchmarking suite in robotics The myriad combinations of robot hardware and robotics software make assessing robotic-system performance challenging, specially in an architecture-neutral, representative, and reproducible manner.
RobotPerf™ addresses this issue delivering a reference performance benchmarking suite that is used to evaluate robotics computing performance across CPU, GPU, FPGA and other compute accelerators. The benchmarks are designed to be representative of the performance of a robotic system and to be reproducible across different robotic systems. For that, , the de facto standard for robot application development.
Mission Represented by consortium of robotics leaders from industry, academia and research labs, RobotPerf™ is formated as an open project whose mission is to build open, fair and useful robotics benchmarks that are technology agnostic, vendor-neutral and provide unbiased evaluations of robotics computing performance for hardware, software, and services.
Purpose Benchmarking assists in performance evaluation. Roboticists can use performance data to develop more efficient robotic systems and choose the appropriate hardware for each robotic application with the help of performance data. It can also aid in comprehending the trade-offs between algorithms implementing the same skill.
Standards RobotPerf™ aligns to robotics standards so that you don’t spend time reinventing the wheel and re-develop what already works for most. Particularly benchmarks are conducted using the as its common baseline. RobotPerf™ also aligns to standardization initiatives within the ROS ecosystem related to computing performance and benchmarking such as REP 2008 ( ). See the RobotPerf™ Specification for more details.
RobotPerf™ source code Why?
Robot behaviors take the form of computational graphs, with data flowing between computation Nodes, across physical networks (communication buses) and while mapping to underlying sensors and actuators. The popular choice to build these computational graphs for robots these days is the Robot Operating System (ROS), a framework for robot application development. ROS enables you to build computational graphs and create robot behaviors by providing libraries, a communication infrastructure, drivers and tools to put it all together. Most companies building real robots today use ROS or similar event-driven software frameworks. ROS is thereby the common language in robotics, with several hundreds of companies and thousands of developers ROS and solves many of the problems in building reliable robotics systems.
vendor solutions support, and with a variety of modular packages, each implementing a different robotics feature that simplifies performance benchmarking in robotics.

More about ROS Robotics Computing Performance: Visualizing For robotic architects, delving into the multifaceted dimensions of computing performance is crucial, yet often intricate. RobotPerf™ stands as a beacon in this space, offering a range of visualizations tailored for clarity and depth. One such illustration is the polar plot, which displays benchmarks within a particular robotic computing category on separate axes. Through RobotPerf™, architects can instantly perceive a system's proficiency across these benchmarks.
They can pinpoint both the strengths and areas of improvement, and thereby make informed decisions in design and optimization. With RobotPerf™, the complexity of robotics computing performance is transformed into actionable insights, making the architect's role not only simpler but also more effective.
Robot Benchmarks : Two benchmarking approaches GREY-BOX is an application-specific measure capable of watching internal states of the system that can measure (probe) certain points in the system, thus generate the measurement data with minimal interference incurring into a minimal average latency of only 3.3 us, making it well-suited for real-time systems. This approach is more complex, but it offers a more detailed analysis, and makes it more appealing for real-world robotic applications and real-time systems, but a less good choice for quick prototyping.
BLACK-BOX measures performance by eliminating the layers above the layer-of-interest and replacing those with a specific test application or compute node. While this approach doesn't need extra instrumentation, and is easier to implement, it offers a less detailed analysis, has limited data points, and uses a non-standard data format while altering the computational graph (introducing new nodes). This makes it less appealing for real-world robotic applications and real-time systems, but a good choice for quick prototyping.
RobotPerf™ categories RobotPerf™ benchmarks aim to cover the complete robotics pipeline including perception , localization , communications middleware , control , manipulation and navigation New categories may appear over time .
Localization Communications middleware Control Navigation Manipulation Benchmarks summary - beta ( report ) (plots are interactive) PERCEPTION CONTROL MANIPULATION (HAWG) and drive the creation, and Gazebo.

Benchmarks Launch your ROS graphs into the cloud Supporting the top cloud service providers Hardware acceleration in the cloud for ROS Leveraging the cloud provides roboticists with unlimited resources to further accelerate computations. Besides lots of CPU, cloud computing providers such as GCP, Azure or AWS offer instances that provide big FPGAs and GPUs for on-cloud hardware acceleration. This means once the ROS graph is partially in the cloud, architects can use custom accelerators to reduce and optimize robotic computations. But tapping into all that power while aligned with common ROS and robotics development flows is non-trivial.

Accelerating metal part manufacturing with robots Heavy metallic parts are manipulated by machinery and robots with tasks involving soldering and assembly. The environment is characterized by large robots and slow-communicating large machinery and equipment, with workers overseeing the slow process. In our work with Grupo Celsa we accelerated their robotic vision pipelines by more than 62x , down to milliseconds, enabling faster robot manipulation and real-time quality control.
The challenge The traditional process of soldering and assembling heavy metallic parts is slow and labor-intensive. These parts often have unstructured surfaces, requiring robots to rely on advanced perception systems powered by computer vision for precise manipulation. The challenge lies in speeding up these perception systems to enhance robotic efficiency and enable real-time quality control.

Robot Operating System (ROS) The de facto framework for robot application development ROS is the common language roboticists use to build robots. It's an open source and modular set of software libraries and tools that help you build robot applications. It provides a message-passing system between software components, drivers for robot hardware, state-of-the-art robotic algorithms, and powerful developer tools to test, debug and visualize your robot.
Why is ROS so important?
Robots are networks of networks, with sensors capturing data, passing to compute technologies, and then on to actuators and back again in a deterministic manner. These networks can be understood as the nervous system of the robot, passing across compute Nodes , that represent neurons . Like the human nervous systems, real-time information across all these computational Nodes is fundamental for the robot to behave coherently.
"Robot brains" are built with this same philosophy. Behaviors take the form of computational graphs, with data flowing between Nodes, across physical networks (communication buses) and while mapping to underlying sensors, compute technologies and actuators.
ROS enables you to build these computational graphs and create robot behaviors by providing libraries, a communication infrastructure, drivers and tools to put it all together.

Other products ROBOTCORE Speed up your ROS tf ) is an optimized robotics transform library that manages efficiently the transformations between coordinate systems in a robot.
tf2 ) library , ROBOTCORE delivers higher throughput and lower latency while aligning with the standard way to keep track of coordinate frames and transform data within a ROS robotic system.
Robotics consulting?
Accelerated coordinate transformations ( tf ) The ROS tf2 library manages the transformations between coordinate systems in a robot. It does so by using a directed single rooted tree that has methods for 1) registration of transformation information and 2) computation of coordinate transformations. The cool thing about tf2 is that it allows to transform data in time as well as in space, which makes it a centric component in the ROS ecosystem being used in popular robotics stacks including navigation2 , moveit2 and Autoware.Auto .
ROBOTCORE introduces architectural upgrades in the tf2 implementation and leverages hardware acceleration to create customized transform data pipelines that deliver higher throughput and lower the latency while reading (or publishing) the tf2 tree. ROBOTCORE is served either as source code or as an IP which allows your ROS computational graphs to easily integrate it. Delivering lower latency and higher throughput , it's API-compatible with tf2 library simplifying its integration in existing robots, so that you don’t spend time reinventing the wheel and re-developing what already works.
Benchmarks Why tf2 ?
To keep track of a robot's position, and the rest of the world in relation to itself tf2 allows roboticists to keep track of multiple coordinate frames over time. It maintains the relationship between coordinate frames in a graph-like data structure (a tree) that is buffered in time, and lets the ROS graph-users to transform data between any two coordinate frames at any desired point in time, provided such point is available within the buffers.
tf2 is generally best understood via example: consider a robot fleet consisting on 3 robots in a warehouse that start from similar positions. Each robot senses the environment using the laser mounted on its top ( base_link_laser frame), as well as the lasers readings from the other robots. The challenge on each robot to integrate all these laser readings requires knowledge of the relationship over time and over space between the laser ( base_link_laser frame), to the base ( base_link frame), to the ground level ( base_footprint frame), to the world frame ( map frame) and back to whichever frame ends up being used to compute the sensor fusion. After all, sensor readings can only be integrated when expressed in the same coordinate frame.
Up to 5x faster tf2 tree operations tf2 sits at the core of navigation2 , moveit2 and Autoware.Auto (among others). For every motion computation, the tf2 tree gets accessed many times. This makes tf2 a very time-sensitive component in high performance robots, wherein both latency and throughput must be carefully considered.
That's where ROBOTCORE comes to play. It introduces architectural upgrades in the tf2 implementation and leverages hardware acceleration delivering a 5x latency speedup in coordinate transformations.
Developer-ready documentation and support is served by seasoned ROS developers and for ROS development.
It ships as a complement to ROBOTCORE either as IP, or as source code. It includes documentation, examples, reference designs and the possibility of various levels of support.

Multiple Cameras for Extended Coverage.
Occlusion Handling If the Occlusion Handling (OH) variant of the control system is enabled, a Depth Grid Map is generated in the form of a file that can live either in the CPU or in the FPGA memory. The Depth Grid Map contains the mapping from one camera, the principal camera, and the other cameras introduced in the system, the secondary cameras. The principal camera's view volume is divided into a grid by dividing it into pixels (in x and y) and by a user-defined depth value in the z-axis, generating a 2.5D frustum. Each cell contains data on the pixel region and depth in which they are visible in other cameras. This mapping is then used to query the different images during the distance evaluation stage. As a result, the system can handle occlusions across cameras and provide a more accurate representation of the robot's environment, enhancing its safety and reliability while delivering the evasive behaviors required for safe human-robot collaboration.
The Control Theory Behind Depth Image-Based Robot Control Our system captures depth images of the robot and its surroundings, requiring calibration of the relative positions between the robot and the camera. The robot's geometry is filtered out, and critical distances from control points on the robot to the surrounding depth camera detections are identified.
Control points are defined using TF frames on the robot's geometry, typically on the axes connecting the joints. These points can be added by including link elements without geometry to the robot's URDF/XACRO model . The distribution of these points should ensure the entire robot is covered within the repulsive potential field's saturation region . The distance between consecutive points should generally be less than \(\left(\frac{-3}{\alpha} + 1\right) \frac{\rho}{2}\). More points increase precision but also computation time.
Based on these distances, a Cartesian repulsive vector and an attractive configuration (PID) vector are computed. These vectors are combined in joint space to obtain a velocity command . The repulsion intensity (\(v_{\text{rep}}\)) is regulated by a curve defined by \(v_{\text{max}}\), \(\rho\), \(d_{\text{min}}\), and \(\alpha\).
This velocity command is limited based on joint velocity limits from other control points and smoothed through an acceleration filter before being transmitted to the robot.
The operation of this system is as follows: A stream of depth images is captured, showing the target robot and its immediate surroundings. The relative positions between the robot and the camera must be calibrated.
The robot's geometry is filtered out from these images.
The filtered image is analyzed to identify critical distances from control points defined on the robot's geometry to the detections from the surrounding depth camera. An example of these control points for a UR10e robot can be seen in the following image. These control points are defined using TF frames located on the robot's geometry, typically on the axes connecting the joints. These points can be simply defined by adding a series of `link` elements without associated geometry to the robot's URDF/XACRO model. The process of adding/modifying these control points to the configuration of the various involved nodes and the controller will be reflected in the documentation provided with the solution code. The distribution of these points along the robot's geometry should generally be sufficient to ensure that the entire volume of the robot is covered within the saturation region of the repulsive potential field function. This function appears in the next step, but as a rule of thumb, the distance between consecutive points should generally be less than \(\left(\frac{-3}{\alpha} + 1\right) \frac{\rho}{2}\). It is worth noting that the greater the number and density of these points, the more precise the coverage of the geometry at the cost of increased computation time.
Based on these distances for the end effector control point, a Cartesian repulsive vector is computed, and based on the current goal, an attractive configuration (PID) vector is also computed. These vectors are combined in joint space to obtain a velocity command. The intensity of the repulsion (\(v_{\text{rep}}\)) is regulated by a curve defined by the attached image: Where \(v_{\text{max}}\) is the maximum Cartesian repulsion velocity, \(\rho\) is the radius around a control point where obstacles are considered, \(d_{\text{min}}\) is the minimum distance from the control point to the obstacle, and \(\alpha\) is a shape factor that regulates the slope of the curve.
This velocity command is then limited based on velocity limits for each joint computed from the other control points.
The joint command limited to these new limits is smoothed through an acceleration filter.
This smoothed command is transmitted to the robot.
