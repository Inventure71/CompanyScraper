ACEINNA To Reveal Latest Automotive & Industrial Power Solutions at APEC - Aceinna: Leader in MEMS Sensor Technology About ACEINNA Company Leadership Team Products Inertial Systems Current Sensors Flow Sensors News Room Corporate News Publications Support Support Forum Manuals Quality System Sales Support Careers Contact Us Home / Corporate News / March 12, 2023 ACEINNA To Reveal Latest Automotive & Industrial Power Solutions at APEC Current Sensors for Next Generation Power Conversion and Management for Data Centers, Telecom & Server Farms, UPS, Motor Drives & Inverters, Electric Vehicle Batteries & Charging Infrastructure ACEINNA Single Chip solutions provide 1.5 MHz bandwidth and supports fast switching SiC and GaN power stages March 14, 2023 ACEINNA Inc. (pronounced “A See Nah”), today announced that they will be at APEC https://apec-conf.org/ (March 19 to 23, 2023 in Orlando, Florida) and will be showing their newest high power current sensing solutions in Booth 863.
“ACEINNA current sensors maximize the benefits of using SiC/GaN and help further increase the overall power conversion efficiency while improving the safety thanks to their industry leading high accuracy, high bandwidth, and fast response time. They are used in broad number of applications ranging from solar panel inverters, wind turbines, data center power supplies, motor drivers in industrial and on-board chargers and fast DC chargers, traction invertors and various power supply and conversion applications in automotive,” said Teoman Ustun (VP Automotive Business Unit). “ACEINNA’s family of MCx2101 (AEC-Q100 qualified Automotive) and MCx1101 (industrial) isolated AMR current sensors provide state-of-the-art performance in a cost effective, easy to use, plug and play component.” Silicon Carbide (SiC) and Galium Nitride (GaN) are starting to replace Silicon MOSFETs. These new transistors are enabling higher frequency systems with better efficiency and smaller size.
When developing power solutions using these higher frequencies, engineers require a higher bandwidth current sensor for the current control loop.
Totem pole PFC requires fast switching ripple current measurement. Motor and inverter apps also require fast ripple current measurement. Higher bandwidth sensors enable fast step response in protection circuits.
ACEINNA Current Sensors are simple to integrate – easy to design in. This small single chip isolated current sensing solution require only a decoupling capacitor, 1.5 MHz frequency response enables SiC/GaN advantages such as higher frequency, smaller system size, and better system efficiency. Benchmark Step Response Time (300ns) minimizes protection timing budget for current sensor and enables the protection of higher frequency SiC/GaN switches. Benchmark Accuracy (0.6% typical) over temperature for ICs provides better control and regulation to improve efficiency and reliability. Low offset and low noise provides high accuracy across the dynamic range If you are interested in setting up a meeting at APEC, please contact Eric Brown, Director – Channel Sales, via email ebrown@aceinna.com or phone 978 395 1045 More about ACEINNA’s current sensor solutions at https://www.aceinna.com/current-sensors ABOUT ACEINNA ACEINNA Inc., is a leading provider of sensing solutions for automotive, industrial, telecom, datacenter, agricultural and construction markets.

ACEINNA Launches High Power, 65 Amp Current Sensor - Aceinna: Leader in MEMS Sensor Technology About ACEINNA Company Leadership Team Products Inertial Systems Current Sensors Flow Sensors News Room Corporate News Publications Support Support Forum Manuals Quality System Sales Support Careers Contact Us Home / Corporate News / December 1, 2021 ACEINNA Launches High Power Current Sensor 65 Amp, AMR Based, Fully Isolated Current Sensor available in 3.3- and 5-Volt versions Fully integrated Current Sensor for Wide Bandgap power applications like DC Fast Charging, Server, Telecom & Industrial Power Supplies, Industrial Robots and Manufacturing Systems, Home Automation & IoT applications, Appliances, Inverters, Motor Control, and other critical applications Andover, Massachusetts- December 1, 2021 ACEINNA today announced the high current ± 65 Amp MCx1101 Current Sensor, the industry’s most accurate and highest bandwidth current sensor. Designed for WBG (wideband gap) applications, and available in 3.3- and 5-Volt versions, this highly accurate, wide bandwidth AMR-based ( Anisotropic Magnetoresistive) current sensor is ideal for a wide range of next generation power systems and applications. Units are now available for sampling and volume shipments.
The MCx11-1’s fast response and high bandwidth is ideal for fast switching SiC and GaN based power stages and enables power system designers to make use of the higher speeds and smaller components enabled by wide band-gap switches. Output step response time is just 0.3us. The MCx1101 also provides an integrated over current detection flag to help implement the OCD (Over Current Detection) required in modern power systems. Over current detection response time is a fast 0.2us.
“ ACEINNA’s MCx1101 current sensors are fully integrated, bi-directional and provide much higher DC and AC accuracy and dynamic range compared with alternative solutions,” says Teoman Ustun, VP of Marketing, ACEINNA. “For example, the new ±65 Amp versions have a typical accuracy of ±3%. This new current sensor utilizes an industry standard SOIC-16 package with a low impedance (0.9 milli-ohm) current path and are UL/IEC/EN 60950-1 certified for isolated applications.” This new current sensor delivers a unique combination of high accuracy, 1.5MHz signal bandwidth with industry benchmark phase shift vs. frequency, fast output step response and 4.8kV isolation making them ideal for current sensing in fast current control loops and protection for high performance power supplies, inverters, and motor control applications.
In addition to the new ±65Amp version, ACEINNA’s current sensor family includes ±50, ±20, and ±5 Amp ranges, and is offered in both fixed gain (MCA1101) and ratiometric gain (MCR1101) versions.
All About AMR AMR ( Anisotropic Magnetoresistive) technology has significant advantages vs. other approaches such as Hall, CT (current transformer), and shunt resistors. Compared to Hall-based current sensors, AMR provides significantly higher bandwidth and dynamic range; Compared with CT’s, AMR offers reduced size and cost, as well as response to dc; in comparison with a shunt resistor, AMR provides a fully integrated solution, eliminating the external amplifier and related circuitry required for high voltage isolation, which is a significant challenge at high frequencies. In addition, shunt resistors require enough IR drop to achieve accuracy goals at the low end of the current range, which often means they are dissipating undesirable levels of power at nominal currents. By contrast, the AMR device only measures the magnetic field generated by the current, so the I 2 R losses can be minimized.

MCA1101-65-5 - Aceinna: Leader in MEMS Sensor Technology About ACEINNA Company Leadership Team Products Inertial Systems Current Sensors Flow Sensors News Room Corporate News Publications Support Support Forum Manuals Quality System Sales Support Careers Contact Us Current Sensor ICs Need help?
Power architects are continually asked to push the boundaries for system efficiency, response time, small size, and low cost in new power system designs.
Most modern designs require current sensors to help implement the complicated control, telemetry, and protection circuitry essential in meeting these difficult design goals.
Often, choosing the right current sensor plays key part in achieving these goals, especially when higher voltages, higher power levels and difficult ambient conditions come into play.
Aceinna’s new family of MCx1101 AMR current sensor ICs now provide design engineers with a compelling alternative for new system designs by offering benchmark performance for accuracy, high bandwidth with low phase delay and response time all integrated within an easy-to-use, cost effective, single component solution.
The MCx1101 is an ideal match for many challenging power applications including motor control, inverters, uninterruptible power supplies (UPS), and industrial power systems as well as AC-DC and DC-DC power systems used in the telecom and high performance computing (HPC) markets.

ACEINNA Launches High Power, 65 Amp Current Sensor - Aceinna: Leader in MEMS Sensor Technology About ACEINNA Company Leadership Team Products Inertial Systems Current Sensors Flow Sensors News Room Corporate News Publications Support Support Forum Manuals Quality System Sales Support Careers Contact Us Home / Corporate News / December 1, 2021 ACEINNA Launches High Power Current Sensor 65 Amp, AMR Based, Fully Isolated Current Sensor available in 3.3- and 5-Volt versions Fully integrated Current Sensor for Wide Bandgap power applications like DC Fast Charging, Server, Telecom & Industrial Power Supplies, Industrial Robots and Manufacturing Systems, Home Automation & IoT applications, Appliances, Inverters, Motor Control, and other critical applications Andover, Massachusetts- December 1, 2021 ACEINNA today announced the high current ± 65 Amp MCx1101 Current Sensor, the industry’s most accurate and highest bandwidth current sensor. Designed for WBG (wideband gap) applications, and available in 3.3- and 5-Volt versions, this highly accurate, wide bandwidth AMR-based ( Anisotropic Magnetoresistive) current sensor is ideal for a wide range of next generation power systems and applications. Units are now available for sampling and volume shipments.
The MCx11-1’s fast response and high bandwidth is ideal for fast switching SiC and GaN based power stages and enables power system designers to make use of the higher speeds and smaller components enabled by wide band-gap switches. Output step response time is just 0.3us. The MCx1101 also provides an integrated over current detection flag to help implement the OCD (Over Current Detection) required in modern power systems. Over current detection response time is a fast 0.2us.
“ ACEINNA’s MCx1101 current sensors are fully integrated, bi-directional and provide much higher DC and AC accuracy and dynamic range compared with alternative solutions,” says Teoman Ustun, VP of Marketing, ACEINNA. “For example, the new ±65 Amp versions have a typical accuracy of ±3%. This new current sensor utilizes an industry standard SOIC-16 package with a low impedance (0.9 milli-ohm) current path and are UL/IEC/EN 60950-1 certified for isolated applications.” This new current sensor delivers a unique combination of high accuracy, 1.5MHz signal bandwidth with industry benchmark phase shift vs. frequency, fast output step response and 4.8kV isolation making them ideal for current sensing in fast current control loops and protection for high performance power supplies, inverters, and motor control applications.
In addition to the new ±65Amp version, ACEINNA’s current sensor family includes ±50, ±20, and ±5 Amp ranges, and is offered in both fixed gain (MCA1101) and ratiometric gain (MCR1101) versions.
All About AMR AMR ( Anisotropic Magnetoresistive) technology has significant advantages vs. other approaches such as Hall, CT (current transformer), and shunt resistors. Compared to Hall-based current sensors, AMR provides significantly higher bandwidth and dynamic range; Compared with CT’s, AMR offers reduced size and cost, as well as response to dc; in comparison with a shunt resistor, AMR provides a fully integrated solution, eliminating the external amplifier and related circuitry required for high voltage isolation, which is a significant challenge at high frequencies. In addition, shunt resistors require enough IR drop to achieve accuracy goals at the low end of the current range, which often means they are dissipating undesirable levels of power at nominal currents. By contrast, the AMR device only measures the magnetic field generated by the current, so the I 2 R losses can be minimized.

Power architects are continually asked to push the boundaries for system efficiency, response time, small size, and low cost in new power system designs.
Most modern designs require current sensors to help implement the complicated control, telemetry, and protection circuitry essential in meeting these difficult design goals.
Often, choosing the right current sensor plays key part in achieving these goals, especially when higher voltages, higher power levels and difficult ambient conditions come into play.
Aceinna’s new family of MCx1101 AMR current sensor ICs now provide design engineers with a compelling alternative for new system designs by offering benchmark performance for accuracy, high bandwidth with low phase delay and response time all integrated within an easy-to-use, cost effective, single component solution.
The MCx1101 is an ideal match for many challenging power applications including motor control, inverters, uninterruptible power supplies (UPS), and industrial power systems as well as AC-DC and DC-DC power systems used in the telecom and high performance computing (HPC) markets.

ACEINNA To Reveal Latest Automotive & Industrial Power Solutions at APEC - Aceinna: Leader in MEMS Sensor Technology About ACEINNA Company Leadership Team Products Inertial Systems Current Sensors Flow Sensors News Room Corporate News Publications Support Support Forum Manuals Quality System Sales Support Careers Contact Us Home / Corporate News / March 12, 2023 ACEINNA To Reveal Latest Automotive & Industrial Power Solutions at APEC Current Sensors for Next Generation Power Conversion and Management for Data Centers, Telecom & Server Farms, UPS, Motor Drives & Inverters, Electric Vehicle Batteries & Charging Infrastructure ACEINNA Single Chip solutions provide 1.5 MHz bandwidth and supports fast switching SiC and GaN power stages March 14, 2023 ACEINNA Inc. (pronounced “A See Nah”), today announced that they will be at APEC https://apec-conf.org/ (March 19 to 23, 2023 in Orlando, Florida) and will be showing their newest high power current sensing solutions in Booth 863.
“ACEINNA current sensors maximize the benefits of using SiC/GaN and help further increase the overall power conversion efficiency while improving the safety thanks to their industry leading high accuracy, high bandwidth, and fast response time. They are used in broad number of applications ranging from solar panel inverters, wind turbines, data center power supplies, motor drivers in industrial and on-board chargers and fast DC chargers, traction invertors and various power supply and conversion applications in automotive,” said Teoman Ustun (VP Automotive Business Unit). “ACEINNA’s family of MCx2101 (AEC-Q100 qualified Automotive) and MCx1101 (industrial) isolated AMR current sensors provide state-of-the-art performance in a cost effective, easy to use, plug and play component.” Silicon Carbide (SiC) and Galium Nitride (GaN) are starting to replace Silicon MOSFETs. These new transistors are enabling higher frequency systems with better efficiency and smaller size.
When developing power solutions using these higher frequencies, engineers require a higher bandwidth current sensor for the current control loop.
Totem pole PFC requires fast switching ripple current measurement. Motor and inverter apps also require fast ripple current measurement. Higher bandwidth sensors enable fast step response in protection circuits.
ACEINNA Current Sensors are simple to integrate – easy to design in. This small single chip isolated current sensing solution require only a decoupling capacitor, 1.5 MHz frequency response enables SiC/GaN advantages such as higher frequency, smaller system size, and better system efficiency. Benchmark Step Response Time (300ns) minimizes protection timing budget for current sensor and enables the protection of higher frequency SiC/GaN switches. Benchmark Accuracy (0.6% typical) over temperature for ICs provides better control and regulation to improve efficiency and reliability. Low offset and low noise provides high accuracy across the dynamic range If you are interested in setting up a meeting at APEC, please contact Eric Brown, Director – Channel Sales, via email ebrown@aceinna.com or phone 978 395 1045 More about ACEINNA’s current sensor solutions at https://www.aceinna.com/current-sensors ABOUT ACEINNA ACEINNA Inc., is a leading provider of sensing solutions for automotive, industrial, telecom, datacenter, agricultural and construction markets.
