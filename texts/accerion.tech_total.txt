Sam Aleksandrov: Finding creative freedom and compatible colleagues in a young, dynamic company 13.05.2021 Successful tech companies are all different but have this one element in common – synchronicity … the shared experiences, personal development opportunities and sense of purpose that make a career far more than just a job.
When Accerion interviews for new hires, Robotics Engineer Sam Aleksandrov says, it’s about more than just skills and qualifications. It’s about bringing together talented self-starters with innate curiosity about technology, then incorporating them into a high-performance team.
“They’re looking at whether the person will fit in the team. It can be the best specialist – the ultimate engineer – but if they don’t fit into the team, it doesn’t work,” says Sam, 29.
If you do fit into the team, Accerion’s support starts early. Anticipating his professional needs started even before he started his job. During his interview, Sam mentioned that if Accerion needed him to do mechanical design, it would be great to have a particular CAD software. “On my first day, they handed me the license for Solidworks,” Sam said.
For someone under 30 years old, Sam has crammed a lot into his personal and professional life. At TU/e, he developed a new mathematical model for calculation of linear induction motors. Having decided the Netherlands is where they want to raise their one-year-old son, he and his wife bought a house.
Since university, he’s written 12 conference papers, three journals, has been invited to speak at an industry conference and has an agreement with his professors to complete his PhD.
Asked what Accerion brings to him, Sam says he’s growing as a person and a professional: “I don’t feel like I’m doing it to earn money … and it brings me a lot of fun, working with nice people on nice projects.” An unconventional career path Sam’s background is in electromechanical engineering, coming to Accerion with an impressive curriculum vitae that includes PhD research in electromechanics at Technical University of Eindhoven. A native of Sofia, Bulgaria, he worked at Hyundai Heavy Industries, followed by a stint working on TU/e’s robotics team during his PhD research.
But in the last year of his PhD, and with only his dissertation to write, he decided he didn’t want a conventional career at a boring company . So, he started looking for options in robotics, querying other students, professors and colleagues for recommendations.
That’s how he heard about this unconventional robotics positioning pioneer called Accerion.
That was two years ago.
An unconventional corporate structure In those two years, he’s thrived in a company Sam says is a perfect fit, with a young team and like-minded colleagues. “We have similar interests. Most of us have a geeky nature. So, we’re all working on multiple projects at home,” including drones and 3D printing.
“We all have geeky hobbies and it’s easy to find counterparts to help you with solutions,” Sam says. “We’re compatible with each other. It’s not like we’re completely from different worlds.” That compatibility extends up and down the Accerion flow chart and its unconventional corporate structure. “More or less, we’re on the same level in terms of communication. We were even starting some of our meetings with, ‘Whaazup!’ And it’s never a problem to talk with a senior person.” That flexibility allows him to more efficiently structure his day. On a recent day in May, Sam worked from 6 a.m. to 8 a.m. before driving his son to daycare, then went to the dentist before returning to work … something larger companies frown on.
So, working at Accerion offers the freedom of an innovative startup but the stability of an established, growing company. “It’s not like you’re three people in a garage and tomorrow it’s over, so you have to go search for another job.” Sam describes himself as more of a generalist than a specialist, interested in a variety of tech and tasks.
Working at Accerion gives him the creative freedom to work on a variety of projects.
“Being a generalist is very important to me,” he says. “I don’t want to write C++ code the whole day or design electric motors the whole day. We have a lot of variety in our work.
That’s the creativity … that unlocks the creativity in your work.
” “Most people are doing robots as a hobby. I have the benefit of doing my hobby as work.” Interested in joining Accerion? Check out our careers page for open positions.

CTO Ronald van Dijk finds the thrills and chills of changing the world ‘irresistible’ 05.10.2021 Just so you know, Accerion CTO Ronald van Dijk isn’t in it necessarily for the money. He’s in it for the thrill. For the excitement of defying the odds and turning concepts into market leaders.
Road racing super-sport motorcycles in the national championship was his hobby for 11 years before switching to drifting cars, so it figures that, in the business world, this translates into Ronald going for the thrills, chills and satisfaction of changing the world at an emerging cutting-edge tech company.
This is not a recent development.
Though Ronald started at global tech innovator Philips , where he did work related to ASML’s semiconductor advancements, what he thrives on is working in an environment with disruptive technology, a focused team and a ground-floor opportunity at a really fast- moving company. “Yeah, that’s irresistible to me,” he says.
As an Eindhoven native, he had plenty of opportunities to feed that passion for tech and innovation: I started out at Philips. If you live in Eindhoven, you should work at Philips. I was fortunate to work in their applied technologies department, so I was always working on ASML and FEI projects. That kind of technology. So really, really high end. I was very fortunate to have a two-year traineeship in precision engineering and control systems.
Gradually, he gravitated toward internal startup teams at the NTS Group, including leading the FEI Phenom Scanning electron microscope (SEM) development team at NTS Mechatronics.
Even in the corporate world, Ronald was all about startups and the next tech wave, always believing the career rewards would outweigh the risks.
Then Ronald really decided to jump off the high-dive. Ronald knew what he was getting into when, in the interview, his prospective employers asked him, “Your wife does have a job, right?” Like so many startups, SoLayTec was a great idea with “a small bag of money,” he said. But it turned out to be just the jump-in-and-do-it culture he was looking for – big plans, big ideas, big ambitions and a small team. It was that rocket ride of Day One, rent office space; Day Two, get furniture; Day Three, buy computers; Day Four, hire personnel “on this crazy timeline.
“I really had a good time!” He spent eight years helping build the company as the chief technology officer working with great teams developing great products in the emerging solar energy sector. Unfortunately, after the rise and rise of SoLayTec, it caught up in the boom-to-bust cycle as Asian competitors took market share and the company was acquired.
Ronald says he left knowing he and his teams had introduced a new standard in solar cell concepts and more than 3 billion high efficiency solar cells manufactured on SoLayTec equipment alone in the process. And knowing he “thoroughly enjoyed working at startups.” Ronald came to Accerion about 18 months ago as an engineering manager who was quickly promoted to CTO. With his background in precision engineering and mechanical engineering, he brings a way of working and a depth of knowledge and experience that dovetails perfectly with Accerion’s talent pool. Though he has experience in technology development, he acknowledges a steep learning curve to master computer vision and robotics.
The good news is, he’s in with a bunch of other over-achievers: “Yeah, I’ve heard that before. I’m not offended in the slightest.” Ronald attributes much of his integration into Accerion’s culture to colleagues, “a great team of highly skilled developers who took time out of their schedule to patiently get me up to speed.” Ronald is leading Accerion’s push into new market niches including Goods to Person intralogistics applications. This is a market U.S. tech research consultancy Gartner projects will quadruple in value by 2023 due to the shift from retail to online shopping, an unexpected trajectory experienced during the coronavirus pandemic.
Accerion has disruptive positioning technology that’s maturing.
“It’s performing better and better each day,” Ronald said. “The ramifications in terms of applying this technology are huge … logistical robots. Home care robots. The applications are close to endless.” Accerion just manufactured its 1000th Triton, the latest positioning technology for mobile robots. Despite the difficulty of the pandemic, Accerion just kept growing, adding customers in five new countries, not just end-users but big names in mobile robot manufacturing such as KUKA and Dutch AGV manufacturer KUMATECH .
That explosive growth is attributed to the company culture which attracts the brave and talented … like Ronald.
The team has doubled in size since the end of 2019, and they are hiring seven more team members, including software engineers, customer success engineers and business developers.
Unlike in the corporate world, working at a small, relatively new company is all about fit and company culture: There has to be click … you basically invest in the team, because at the moment, the team is the company. It has to be a team effort. You have to be focused. You have to be flexible. You have to juggle, which is the nature of startups. The peaks are high, the valleys are deep, and not everybody has the stomach for it. But let’s say you have to have that mentality. We’re focused on open culture-oriented people.
The nature of startups is team members are sure they’re going to conquer the world with their unique proposition, Ronald said: “That youthful exuberance … that’s something you need.
“We just want to conquer the world … nothing more.” previous article Warehouse operators accelerate automation plans to keep up with consumer demand next article Mapping with SLAM: the first step to automating warehouse operations Links: Philips -> https://www.philips.nl/ ASML’s -> https://www.asml.com/en NTS Mechatronics. -> https://www.nts-group.nl/en/about/locations/nts-mechatronics-eindhoven KUKA -> https://www.kuka.com/ KUMATECH -> https://www.kumatech.nl/ Warehouse operators accelerate automation plans to keep up with consumer demand -> https://accerion.tech/news/warehouse-operators-accelerate-automation-plans-to-keep-up-with-consumer-demand/ Mapping with SLAM: the first step to automating warehouse operations -> https://accerion.tech/news/mapping-with-slam-the-first-step-to-automating-warehouse-operations/

Simultaneous localization and mapping – SLAM What is SLAM “mapping?” Simultaneous Localization and Mapping – or SLAM – is a method used to create a map of an environment while localizing a moving mobile robot in the environment at the same time. SLAM is a method, a system of components that requires an odometry source and a global perception system.
There is a variety of tools available to create maps using SLAM. Operators mapping for the first time are free to choose any tools they wish in their SLAM application. Some use 2D Lidar, 3D Lidar, reflectors or cameras, depending on the type of map they wish to create.
Who uses SLAM “mapping?” Accerion’s customers, including warehouse operators, e-commerce companies and manufacturers, use SLAM to create a map for their mobile robots and fleets for specific operations. This is to ensure a bounded global accuracy while mapping the floor in a large operational area.
Warehouse operators often use SLAM sensor Triton, Accerion’s localization system for mobile robots, to map their environments.
First, the floor is mapped using a SLAM robot . Virtual lines of references from the natural floor surface are created and managed by the Triton sensor.
What happens after mapping?
Mapping is the first step, and you no longer need SLAM after mapping the environment is complete. All you need is Triton.
How does Triton work?
Consisting of an optical positioning sensor, an integrated processing unit and Accerion’s highly advanced algorithms, Triton localizes itself using the floor map, ensuring state-of-art repeatability in positioning.
The sensor uses the floor as a map to provide coordinates to the navigation system so robots can localize themselves in the environment.
Triton uses SLAM Triton looks directly at the floor and measures pure displacement, allowing mobile robots to move with sub-millimeter accuracy at high speeds.
Triton is extremely sensitive to the movement of the robot in any direction, which means it works seamlessly in dynamic environments such as parcel sortation operations.
Once the floor is mapped, the Triton sensor can do pure localization and provide pose corrections out of the box using only the floor.
Triton turns mobile robots into high-performance, highly accurate and robust autonomous vehicles without infrastructure.

Meet Triton: Small and versatile … and taking robots where they’ve never gone before 10.01.2020 Accerion is in one of the world’s fastest-growing, fastest-evolving tech sectors as more and more companies use autonomous robotics to automate. To play in this arena, we’re quickly anticipating customer needs by adding greater functionality to our positioning products.
Triton is the newest product using our positioning technology, a more compact, more affordable option for mapping warehouse floors. It’s versatile enough to displace other positioning technologies or integrate into – and enhance – clients’ existing robotic products.
Simply put, Triton can execute where other technologies can’t.
For example, some clients have long, narrow aisles, some as long as 100 meters.
“It’s very, very hard to navigate in that aisle with anything but our technology,” says Accerion System Engineer Ruben Vandenheede. “We have the only navigation technology that can handle that.” “Think of it this way,” says Accerion’s Software Engineer Anurag Kulkarni. “Each section of that long warehouse aisle looks exactly alike. If you try to tell a computer to look visually at the environment, the only thing it sees is repeating objects like the shelves. If I’m here or 10 meters farther or 10 meters farther, it all looks the same and the computer cannot distinguish.” But Triton scans the floor itself and stores the data that allows minute maneuvering even in long, narrow warehouse aisles.
If those aisles store racks, pallets and trolleys that are low to the ground, Triton has no problem with that. In fact, our client Eurotec manufactures the lowest AGV on the market, the Lowpad.
Lowpads fit under equipment such as a rolling rack. It slides under and lifts the rack. Triton then feeds the positioning data to Lowpad’s navigation stack to tell it where to go. This maneuver is done without infrastructure for fast and accurate deployment in those narrow aisles.
This required us to design the Triton to be small and compact. In fact, we actually designed the height specifically so it would fit the height of the Lowpad.
“At first, it was very hard to design it with such a small form factor. But it had to be four centimeters (tall),” Ruben said. “We went from the original Jupiter to a design 10 times smaller as well as more affordable.” Because of its size, Triton is the only product that fits Lowpad and still provides the mm-level accuracy necessary for industrial automators. That makes Triton and Lowpad a match made in heaven.
“Triton is the product of a brilliant team of engineers. Within record time they managed to develop this incredible product,” said Accerion’s Founder and Managing Director Willem-Jan Lamers. “Ruben and Anurag dedicated their efforts full-time to the project – on the hardware and software developments respectively.
“The end-result is a beautifully designed piece of equipment!” That team leveraged in-house knowledge while working with EPR and NTS OPTEL on the optics and with FRAMOS, a German firm that produces advanced vision components, including optics and sensors.
“Those collaborations dramatically accelerated the design process and prototyping, reducing the time it took to get Triton to market,” said Vincent.
Triton is being pilot-tested by several clients now, and Accerion is taking orders with delivery in early 2020. If you’re interested in learning more about Triton, contact us at sales@accerion.tech.

Accerion participates in Interreg’s Smart Tooling Project 28.10.2019 Since 2016, Accerion has worked on the Smart Tooling project sponsored by the European program Interreg Vlaanderen-Nederland.
Objective: SMEs and service providers from the Belgium-Netherlands border region have been working together to develop robot technology. The aim is to strengthen our region’s position in the industry by working together more safely and more cost-effectively.
KicMPi has been responsible for the financial and substantive project management of the Smart Tooling project.
Within the project, the following project partners worked together closely: BASF Dow Benelux Impuls Zeeland REWIN BOM (Brabantse Ontwikkeling Masschap) BEMAS Sirris University of Ghent University of Twente Avans University Currently, 19 Project Partners are actively participating in this project in the form of clusters, namely the inspection cluster, workshop cluster, UAS cluster and cleaning cluster.
The project has been running for almost three years now.
Extension of project duration: The Smart Tooling project started on 1 September 2016. The original end date would have been 31 August 2019. However, on 10 July 2019, we received approval to extend the project duration until 31 May 2020.
A number of subprojects require a longer duration than the current project duration in order to realize the test plans. Due to the extended project duration, the various subprojects can be completed with a qualitative result.
Progress Cluster Cleaning: The cleaning theme focuses on development of a robot that will recognize, loosen and remove contaminants in confined spaces as well as on industrial surfaces. The aim is to use the robot autonomously to recognize and distinguish dirt in order to achieve a higher level of safety and efficiency.
Project partners: Buchen, Group Victor Peeters, VTEC, P. de Boevere B.V., Accerion, Nobleo Technology, Avans University, DERC Waterjetting, BASF, Mourik, Dow Benelux The three service companies providing additional input are Mourik, Buchen and Group Victor Peeters. They share their unique knowledge about cleaning and also provide support within the robotics tests.
Mourik focuses on navigation.
Buchen focuses on the degree of cleaning.
Group Victor Peeters focuses on measurements, data analysis and autonomous working.
The technical group within this cluster is formed by: Accerion VTEC Lasers & Sensors P. de Boevere B.V. (Serenity) Nobleo Technology Avans Hogeschool VTEC focuses on the sensor technology and communication of the data.
P. de Boevere B.V. has the task of focusing on data acquisition, data logging, reporting and data processing.
Within this project, Accerion and Nobleo Technology focus on positioning and navigating the cleaning robot.
In the Cleaning Cluster, DERC Waterjetting supplies a carrier platform (carrier). DERC Waterjetting will design and install the adaptation to the platform.
The goal is to develop the carrier platform for autonomous operation and cleaning.
Nobleo Technology has further developed the navigation software and performed several tests on the test facility at Group Peeters.
A high-pressure test was performed by Mourik in a tank at Dow.
Serenity worked on the dashboard software and organized a meeting to map the interactions between the different systems.
The Avans Foundation has built the pollution-measurement sensor developed by VTEC into a student-designed Inspection robot.
The next step is equipping the robot with a navigation system, then testing these VTEC sensors. Future steps include making improvements on the basis of practical tests with regard to regulating the magnetic strength of the Cleaning robot. A control system will be developed for this purpose. The height of the magnets of the DERC carrier will be adjustable.
In the coming period we will work on the integration of the Serenity-Nobleo technology.

Positioning systems and high accuracy positioning In an Industry 4.0 world with ever-increasing demands and high-performance standards, Accerion’s unique technology stands out with high accuracy positioning, scalability and flexibility.
Since 2015, Accerion has provided positioning technology and systems for the autonomous mobile robot sector. Accerion developed the first 100% infrastructure-free, sub-millimeter accuracy positioning systems for mobile robots and automated guided vehicles.
Current applications focus on the warehousing and manufacturing sectors, but Accerion’s technology is universally applicable. Our goal is to make mobile robots and automated guided vehicles 100% autonomous and independent from infrastructure and operate with high precision in a flexible, dynamic environment.
THE POSITIONING SENSOR Our positioning technology operates with the help of a sensor. This positioning sensor is able to easily and accurately determine the location of the autonomous mobile robot. This is essential in specifically warehouse logistics and production automation. Our advanced positioning sensor enables mobile robots and other industrial vehicles to perform precision work autonomously.
Our positioning sensor looks directly at the floor and measures pure displacement, allowing mobile robots and AGVs to move with sub-millimeter accuracy and at greater speeds.
INDOOR ROBOT POSITIONING SYSTEMS Accerion is disrupting a disruptive industry by changing the mobile robot game: our indoor robot positioning systems turn mobile robots into high performance, highly accurate and robust autonomous vehicles. Without infrastructure.
How’s that work?
Our indoor positioning systems, processing unit and advanced algorithms integrate with navigation stacks of mobile robots.
The positioning sensors scan the warehouse floor and use its unique “signatures” as a reference. The coordinates are sent to the navigation system so mobile robots and AGVs can localize themselves in the environment.
Accerion technology guides robots precisely in any indoor environment. There’s no additional infrastructure – no lasers, no magnetic tape, no induction lines.
OUR MISSION Since 2015, Accerion has been perfecting positioning technology for mobile robots and AGVs . Our mission is to make autonomous mobile robots 100% independent from infrastructure and operate with high precision in a flexible, dynamic environment. One of the fastest-growing markets is Goods to Person . Accerion’s positioning sensor is perfect for this market and provides various warehouses with an ultimate sub-millimeter accurate AGV sensor .
POSITIONING TECHNOLOGY Meet Triton The reality of the logistics business is that margins are thin, and operators are always looking for an edge … which is where Triton comes in.
Triton’s positioning technology was designed and built to automate warehouse and logistics operations . This robot positioning system compact, measuring only 4 cm in height, and its sub-millimeter accuracy enables high performance automation solutions such as high-precision docking, virtual line-following and seamless navigation in dynamic environments.
Triton is the perfect add-on for AGVs and mobile robots. Because Triton is economical, it can be easily integrated into an entire fleet of robots for large warehouse and logistics operations. Just as important, Triton is easy to install and maintain. This adds a whole new level of flexibility, saving time and money … and giving logistics operators a distinct competitive advantage.

After years of perfecting our technology, Accerion is taking the industry where no robots have gone before 18.07.2019 The autonomous robotics revolution might seem futuristic to people outside our deep-tech industry. The reality is, Accerion has spent the past seven years perfecting its indoor positioning systems, the technology that makes truly autonomous robots perform at the highest possible levels.
The result is devices that are incredibly accurate and easy to integrate with robots and other equipment because they don’t require infrastructure … GPS, radio beacons, tracks, magnetic grids or induction lines.
Willem-Jan Lamers founded Accerion in 2015, creating its MVP, the Juno, followed by the Jupiter model. Now there are several Accerion positioning technology modes that integrate with other technologies, including line-following navigation, which allows a mobile robot to trace its movements with total accuracy over and over again.
Deep tech, precise performance So, how does our virtual line-following technology work? We can’t disclose the secret sauce, but we can say with confidence that Accerion technology checks all the boxes – advanced optical sensors and algorithms, embedded software and integrated design.
We are happy to help you understand how our optics-based systems produce the precision – down to sub-mm levels – our clients demand for their mobile robots and the applications at the end-customer.
Engineer Talha Ali Arslan is Accerion Employee No. 1, a guy who’s been fascinated with high tech since he was a kid in Istanbul: “I was always breaking things apart to understand how they worked.” Talha was recruited by Accerion just after he graduated from grad school, so there’s no one better to explain this proprietary technology no one else has.
In its Jupiter system, Accerion uses two optical sensor modules – similar in principle to an optical computer mouse  – in tandem with an on-board computer. “When we designed the Jupiter prototype, we combined the two optical units into one module, so everything is in a single box,” Talha said, including the power source, computation unit and ethernet connecting to other robots on a LAN.
Jupiter positions robots and other devices by scanning and “mapping” the floor of a warehouse, factory or really an environment, “scratches, paint and all,” Talha says.
“When we are mapping the floor, we’re creating our own references. We call them virtual markers. When the Accerion sensor maps the floor, we create dense virtual markers out of the natural surface.” One of the most significant Accerion innovations is figuring how to eliminate “drift,”or the robot veering off the precise path. “Think of it this way,” Talha says, “Count a hundred steps forward, then turn around 180-degrees and walk back 100 steps back. Would you end up in the same location?” “No, because your steps aren’t always the same. The same thing applies to a sensor.” Accerion sensors measure movement and position more than 100 times per second, Talha said: “For absolute location, we have to make sure we detect drift and correct it.” Robots then use that data to follow assigned routes, with Accerion’s optical modules navigating the floor via a process called optical odometry.
Faster, more accurate and more versatile In Accerion’s engineering lab, Talha demonstrates with a Jupiter device attached to a small mobile platform. He quickly teaches it a course, then watches as it retraces the course over and over again, never touching pylons placed as closely as possible to the track, which demonstrates the ability to repeat the robot’s movements with high precision.
“That’s the solution to the absolute localization of the robot,” Talha says.
Accerion technology is evolving quickly and that includes increasing exponentially the maximum speeds robots can travel.
The sensors can also collect and distribute data to robots to keep them away from obstacles and moving toward waypoints even if there are degradations in the surface of the workspace.
The goal for the future is tech that will allow each autonomous vehicle or robot to update those virtual markers automatically, then share updates with multiple robots.
All of this increases what is already versatile positioning technology, with unlimited applications from factories and fulfillment centers to luggage-carrying robots in airports and even robotic rides in theme parks.
Accerion is tailoring capabilities to the market, says Vincent Burg, managing director and partner. “We use line-following in certain areas but with different degrees of detail as needed.
“We have something unique. We work with lots of other technologies, and it all comes together for the most efficient and straight-forward integration.” previous article Accerion closes Series A investment; plans major expansion next article Accerion selected to go on Dutch Boston Trade Mission with Prime Minister Rutte, other government officials Links: Accerion closes Series A investment; plans major expansion -> https://accerion.tech/news/accerion-closes-series-a-investment-plans-major-expansion/ Accerion selected to go on Dutch Boston Trade Mission with Prime Minister Rutte, other government officials -> https://accerion.tech/news/accerion-selected-to-go-on-dutch-boston-trade-mission-with-prime-minister-rutte-other-government-officials/

According to this Dematic article , entrepreneur Arthur Barret of Barrett Electronics invented the world’s first driverless vehicle in 1954 in Northbrook, Illinois. Barret dubbed the vehicle the “Guide-O-Matic,” but it wasn’t until 1980 that it was renamed the Automated Guided Vehicle, or AGV.
AGVs are driverless, wheel-based load carriers used to transport heavy loads in industrial warehouse and manufacturing environments. AGVs follow a prescribed route, moving materials from point to point, increasing efficiency and productivity. AGVs are the “work horses” of the warehouse.
AMRs, on the other hand, are more nimble robots, seen jetting around the warehouse. An AGV may detect an obstacle on its path but cannot navigate around it. AMRs can move around objects, which makes them infinitely flexible. Have you ever seen a fleet of AMRs used in parcel sortation? It’s like watching a well-choreographed dance.
The intralogistics market has exploded in the past two years, and companies are accelerating automation plans to leverage this stratospheric growth. Many are adding AGVs and AMRs to their fleets to increase efficiency and flexibility in high performance operations.
And this is where Accerion’s localization system for mobile robots is helping accelerate growth across industries.
Accerion manufactures a camera-based positioning module called Triton for indoor localization of mobile robots in logistics and manufacturing environments.
Triton enables AGVs and AMRs to navigate in the most accurate, robust way without infrastructure.
It is based on Accerion’s proprietary Texture Vision Technology, which uses unique microstructures of a floor to determine the location. Triton uses the “signatures” or nuances of the existing warehouse floor as a map.
Accerion uses computer vision so mobile robots operate accurately and reliably in intralogistics and manufacturing operations. Once a warehouse floor is mapped using SLAM, the Triton sensor can do pure localization and provide pose corrections out of the box … using only the floor.
Triton is proving to be one of the most reliable and robust localization systems on the market. There is no need for infrastructure, which saves significant time and costs during commissioning of mobile robots. And there is a high level of flexibility and ease when optimizing routes or making changes to a layout after installation.
Triton was designed for easy and fast integration into the most common AMR and AGV vehicles on the market. Triton is compact, measuring only 110 x 110 x 40 mm and is easily mounted at a central position underneath the mobile robot. This makes Triton an easy add-on with no need to change the vehicle design. It works with ROS, C++ and UDP and common navigation of fleet software such as Navitec or Bluebotics.
https://accerion.tech/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Tractor-Tom-AGV-MCM-Marknesse-1.mp4 How Triton powers AGVs Triton enables precise docking and line following of heavy vehicles and forklifts that can’t be easily solved with alternative solutions such as lidar SLAM.
How Triton powers AMRs Triton enables the use of AMRs in environments that were previously impossible or very challenging. With its sub-millimeter accuracy, Triton is the world’s most precise localization solution for operations that demand high flexibility of scaling, such as sorting or distribution capacity.
For the end-user, Triton’s positioning system is used effectively in applications such as inbound logistics, replenishment of picking stock, Goods to Person, Person to Goods, load consolidation/marshalling and further in the supply chain, parcel sortation. For all applications, Triton’s sub-millimeter repeat accuracy results in faster driving, faster docking and more effective fleet operation.
For AGVs and AMRs, Triton provides the most cost-effective and fast-to-commission solution on the market.

The European Robotic Startup Landscape 04.05.2021 Note: Accerion was included in this overview of European Robotics Startups by seed + speed Ventures. This post was published on Medium on April 15, 2021.
By Mathias Bosse, seed + speed Ventures Over the past few decades, roots have gone from incredibly expensive machines with limited functionalities to affordable robots that are flexible and equipped to do multiple jobs. Consequently, robots are highly adopted by people across the globe and various different industries and play an increasing part in our daily personal lives.
As in many other segments, Covid has offered challenges and a major opportunity to robotic firms, especially in the logistics and grocery space. Unforeseen stress tests to supply chains and surging demand on products have emphasized the need for greater supply chain efficiencies. Workforce constraints due to safety protocols and illness have also hammered various sectors.
Robots are surely not new, however rapid technological enhancements and developments like IoT, 5G and AI, are heavily increasing adoption of robotics engineering and technology as well as a growing number of use cases and applications.
To get a better understanding of what’s going on throughout the European robotic startups ecosystem and to identify its trends and challenges, we took a closer look at more than 100 companies from the last seven years (founded 2013 or later).
The European Robotics Startup Map Among the companies we observed, we spotted more than 50 relevant ventures, active in the field of robotics, which we mapped into the following six categories (Industrial, Wearable, Light Duty, Software, Medical, Food & Farming).
Funding and Founding Statistics Throughout our research we identified 58 companies of which more than 50% (unsurprisingly) fall into the Industrial segment (52%, 30 companies), followed by Medical (16%, 9 companies) and Light Duty (12%, 7 companies). The overall number of startups founded in the robotics industry seems rather low compared to other industries. Potentially, this might be due to its deep-tech character and the associated capital requirements as well as the research-intensive nature.
Robotic startups in Europe founded 2014–2021: Companies per segment (source: crunchbase; analysis: Judith Vogel, Mathias Bosse, seed + speed Ventures) The distribution of invested capital is even heavier focused on the Industrial sector. While a total of 357.7 Mio. USD were invested into the 58 companies, more than 70% of the total investment (257 Mio. USD) went into the Industrial sector. The remaining funds are distributed across other segments with the medical sector being the second most relevant. Although the statistics are heavily impacted by Exotec (accounting for 111 Mio. USD in funding) the industrial sector is by far the largest.
Robotic startups in Europe founded 2014–2021: Funding per segment (source: crunchbase; analysis: Judith Vogel, Mathias Bosse, seed + speed Ventures) Taking a closer look at the founding years, we saw founding activities peaking in 2015. Although that does not account for the fact that we are only looking at companies still operating today, it nevertheless shows that startups founded in that year seem to be particularly successful (at least measured by the capital they attracted). We also saw the number of new startups founded since 2015 decrease, which could be attributed to the capital needed to start a robotics business and the challenges to scale and compete with already existing competitors.
Robotic startups in Europe founded 2014–2021: Companies founded and raised funding per vintage (source: crunchbase; analysis: Judith Vogel, Mathias Bosse, seed + speed Ventures) Overall Trends in Robotics While analyzing the startups we have identified and mapped above, we also took a closer look at the trends and innovations that are currently shaping the robotics industry. The following include our key observations: • Autonomous Robots Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) are transforming traditional robot tasks through their increased flexibility and diversified applications, including their unique ability to navigate in an uncontrolled environment with a higher level of understanding.
• Collaborative Robots or Cobots are on the rise Collaborative robots (a.ka. cobots) are a special form of robotic automation built to work safely alongside human workers in a shared, collaborative work environment. A collaborative robot not only frees humans from repetitive tasks, but also prevents industry workers from getting involved in critical and dangerous tasks. Industrial collaborative robots are designed with advanced sensors and software that allow them to detect and react to any human intrusion into their workspace.
• Robot senses improve drastically When combined with powerful processing capabilities, tools like force control and advanced 2-D and 3-D vision will enable an increasing degree of robotic independence and allow the robot to make decisions about what to do when it encounters unforeseen problems in their day to day operations. Therefore, one of the key features needed is a robot that can interact with the world around them. To make this long vision come true, researchers and scientists have included advanced sensing and gripping tools into industrial robots, which power charge their senses.
• 5G will fuel adoption of robotics Mega-trending 5G is poised to deliver unheralded speed and bandwidth and with such enabling real time visibility and processing of high data volumes bringing adaptability and flexibility of robotic automations to a new level. This will not only increase efficiency of existing applications but also enable totally new use cases in the smart factory stack.
Examples of industry-related trends Based on technological advancements and falling prices, robotic applications are becoming relevant in more industries and new use cases. Here are some examples of industry-related trends we found particularly interesting: • The next level of robotics in manufacturing Manufacturing production lines are already largely automated by industrial robots. The next step for these facilities will be to adopt robotic technology that enhances the efficiency of the material handling workflows that support the production lines by using autonomous mobile robots, powered by self-learning capabilities, working perfectly synchronized along the supply chain.
• Robotics conquering construction sites The construction industry is set to see growth as a result of the continued adoption of robotics. Companies like Scaled Robotics will not just be used to assist with actual construction, but for improving visibility and transparency, proactively identifying issues, tracking construction site progress.
• Robots are the farmers of the future One of the most transformative potentials for robotics lies within agriculture. Based on widespread labor shortages this sector is absolutely predestined to benefit from robotic solutions. Furthermore robotic solutions contribute to a more sustainable industry, e.g. Ecorobotics mounted sprayer which drastically reduces the use of chemical products.
Overall the future of robotics seems more than bright and we hope to see a lot more robotic startups come to life in the near future.

Tobias Moll gives us the ins and outs of his internship at Accerion.
29.08.2017 Today we’re zooming in at a few application possibilities of our technology with Tobias Moll, who’s studying applied computer science and has followed an internship with us.
Tobi has been with Accerion for six months, from March to August. During this time, he was responsible for a few important projects, one of them is the development of ‘fully automated learning’.
. “From the first day, I jumped in with both feet. I was immediately involved in testing the hardware of the sensor, which was really cool. When this was done, I sat down with Willem-Jan and we talked about the possible topics that would be interesting for me to work on. It was really nice to be able to choose my own assignment and not be forced into a specific topic. It was up for discussion and anything was possible. Accerion is really open for new ideas.” ‘Eventually the project came down to a ‘smart indoor mapping system’, which is also the subject of my thesis. For Accerion the goal was to improve the usage of the sensor, for me I wanted to develop a mobile robot system. The project consists of three main topics: – Raspberry pi (to detect special markers on the floor I used computer vision with a raspberry pi) – Lidar sensor (combination with Jupiter to avoid obstacles and make the system safer) – Developing mobile application so the system can drive around autonomously and map the environment.
The goal was to improve the usage of the sensor. For that to happen we had to make markers on the floor and create a system that drives autonomously while mapping the environment.’ “Being flexible is one of the most important things I learned” ‘I found my internship to be really cool. I chose this specific one because I didn’t want to be bound to one topic. Choosing for a start-up means you can experience everything and you’re not limited to your assignment. You see everything from finance, to customers to the technology. You’re involved in everything.
I learned a lot in this period. But being flexible is the most important one. By working here, I learned that a lot more is possible than you think. Even when it looks like a huge job, no matter how complicated it seems, you cán develop it. Just start. Do it in small pieces and write your tasks down. Also, interacting with customers thought me a lot about communication. It important to not only be good at your job but at other elements as well.
Look around and leave your island from time to time.’ “Tobi showed to be a very valuable addition to our team. He proved to be able to tackle all kinds of challenges, both related to his thesis as well as many others. His flexibility, curiosity, ability to interact with all types of stakeholders, and broad knowledge about robotics and related systems will prove to be valuable skills during his future career. Tobi is a great guy on both the technical and personal level!” – Willem-Jan Lamers “Working with Tobi was an absolute pleasure. He was part of the team from day 1. His always positive approach and clever problem solving made him a great guy to work with.” – Vincent Burg previous article Accerion Jupiter Longrun Timelapse next article Accerion is the 9th most innovative company in 2017!

CeMAT 2016 31.05.2016 CeMAT is on the same location as Hanover Messe. While it is quite a bit smaller, it only includes material handling equipment, tools and services. Many interesting companies in this field were presenting their products and vision of the future.
Material handling in logistics and manufacturing is one of the focal points of Accerion’s positioning solution. It was interesting to see how many manufacturers are now looking to automate their forklifts, heavy lifting and other transport solutions. I was quite surprised however that some manufacturers indicated that they don’t see automation happening.
One day was enough to cover most ground and contact the companies and people on my list –  plus several interesting companies along the way.

Partner Showcase: Fraunhofer IML and Accerion technology pair up for “heavy lifting” 13.11.2019 Today we launch a new series highlighting our relationships with valued partners and how we work together.
We start with world-class logistics automation partner and the largest research institute in the field of logistics in Europe, Fraunhofer Institute for Material Flow and Logistics, or IML.
Accerion is fortunate to benefit from Fraunhofer IML’s years of industry experience to improve our unique positioning technology and products. That’s what makes them true industry partners.
Accerion doesn’t build mobile robots, nor do we create software to make them drive autonomously. What we developed is positioning technology to help autonomous guided vehicles – or AGVs – know where to go.
Accerion provides the positioning technology that integrates with Fraunhofer IML’s vehicle Navigation Controller – Nav.-Con. – and AGV fleet and traffic management system, openTCS.
https://youtu.be/OxadwnQ5PMAFraunhofer IML does much of the heavy lifting in this video, including integrating Accerion’s software in their Nav.-Con. software platform and supporting i-COW in the integration of the vehicles. This demonstrates how all the technology works together for fast, smooth and accurate pallet pickup and placement.
This is logistics automation and industry partnership at its finest!

Solutions Triton as Standalone Localization System Integrating Triton in Lidar-SLAM “The integration of the Triton in our robot has been straight-forward. We are currently using it for line following, and we are amazed by its precision!” - PAL Robotics "With Accerion's sensors we can navigate our customers' AMRs very accurately. Even in the most complex and dynamic environments." - Ruvu “We have worked with Accerion’s team from the early days of our development of the Autonomous Sorting solution. The team is dedicated to our success and has been supporting us through development and operations.” - Prime Vision FAQ Accerion’s infrastructure-free localization technology with sub-millimeter-level accuracy gives mobile robots the ability to perform precision work in dynamic environments.
But how does it work and which floors are supported?
HOW DOES IT WORK?
Our systems use optical sensors with built-in processing and storage to localize based on the floor. Using our advanced algorithms, the optical sensor is able to detect unique features in each section of the floor to later provide a sub-mm accurate position back to a mobile robot (AGV or AMR).
WHICH FLOORS ARE SUPPORTED?
Triton needs a textured floor to operate. there are many floors out there, and Triton supports the vast majority of industrial and logistics floors.
To be more precise, it supports 1) all concrete floors, 2) any pre-qualified floors and 3) tested floors.
Testing takes seconds with any standard Triton or can be supported by our team.

AGV Sensor AGVs can add immediate value in automating operations and improving efficiencies for manufacturers. AGVs can be added as needed so there is no great outlay in capital improvements. To further automate, AGV navigation can be added to mobile robot fleets.
Sensor for automated guided vehicles Accerion’s positioning system and AGV sensor support a diverse range of industries and specialized applications. Accerion was founded by Willem-Jan Lamers after an epiphany – the global economy was entering the Fourth Industrial Revolution, and since 2015, Accerion has been perfecting localization technology and AGV sensors for the mobile robotics industry.
AGV sensor: meet Triton Fast-forward to 2021, and mobile robots and AGVs are evolving at an exponential rate with new uses and applications being developed every day. Our AGV sensor evolves as our customer needs – and markets – change. We’ve been focused on logistics and manufacturing, but our technology is universally applicable in other specialized applications such as Goods to Person.
AGV Navigation Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) and Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) may look like something from a sci-fi film, but the truth is, these industrial mobile robots are relevant now more than ever, and their use is booming in intralogistics and manufacturing applications.
About AGVs en AMRs Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) and Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) may look like something from a sci-fi film, but the truth is, these industrial mobile robots are relevant now more than ever, and their use is booming in intralogistics and manufacturing applications.
Growing market The global AGV market alone is expected to grow from $2B to $3.72B by 2028, and we see many warehouse operators – whether in manufacturing, intralogistics or other application areas – moving forward with their plans to automate.
Take the manufacturing industry .
AGVs can add immediate value in automating operations and improving efficiencies for manufacturers. AGVs can be added as needed so there is no great outlay in capital improvements. To further automate, AGV navigation can be added to mobile robot fleets.
How does Triton work?
Our newest positioning system , Triton, sets the new standard in positioning for manufacturers and logistics operators who demand the highest degree of flexibility, adaptability, speed and precision.
Guiding Mobile Robots into the Future Consisting of an optical AGV sensor, an integrated processing unit, and Accerion’s algorithms, Triton scans the floor surface beneath robots and uses it as a reference. Triton uses the floor surface as a map to provide coordinates to the AGV’s navigation system so robots can localize themselves in the environment.
Your floor is literally Triton’s map, so there is no infrastructure required. No magnetic tape, no laser reflectors, no QR codes.
Improved performance and new features for Triton Accerion is at the center of the world’s fastest-growing and evolving tech sector. To play in this arena, we anticipate customer needs and add greater functionality to our positioning products. With the latest update, we’ve added a floor qualifier function to the newest generation of AGV sensor. The floor qualifier is used to assess the performance of Triton on a floor type.
AGV sensor for high-accuracy positioning We developed the floor qualifier internally for our customer success team, but it’s proven so valuable we’re making it available on Tritons for every customer. And we’ve introduced an idle mode that reduces owner consumption. The software can now go into a 6-watt idle mode from 15 watts, using 60 percent less power while in idle mode.
Natural (feature) navigation AGV Which is where Triton, Accerion’s navigation AGV system, comes in to help manufacturers scale quickly. Natural navigation for AGVs at its best.
Triton allows AGVs to drive fast and accurately, down to the sub-millimeter level. Triton’s secret sauce is its infrastructure-free feature, meaning there are no wires in the floor, reflectors or QR codes. Triton uses the “signatures” or nuances in the existing warehouse floor as a map, then sends those coordinates to the AGV navigation system.
AGV laser navigation To get anywhere, you need a map. This is especially true for mobile robots, and this is where SLAM comes in.
Simultaneous Localization and Mapping – or SLAM – is a method used to create a map of an environment while localizing a moving mobile robot in the environment at the same time.
SLAM is a method using a system of components that requires an odometry source and a global perception system.
Accerion’s customers, including warehouse operators, e-commerce companies and manufacturers, use AGV laser navigation to create a map for their mobile robots and fleets for specific operations. The AGV laser navigation is to ensure a bounded global accuracy while mapping the floor in a large operational area.
AMR navigation Once the environment is mapped, all you need is Triton for AGV and AMR navigation.
Accerion uses computer vision so AGVs and AMRs operate accurately and reliably in high-performance intralogistics operations. Once the floor is mapped, the Triton sensor can do pure localization and provide pose corrections out of the box using only the floor.
Key feature This key feature – infrastructure-free guidance of mobile robots – enables AMRs to perform precision work autonomously, even in dynamic environments.
For the end-user, Triton’s AGV and AMR navigation are used effectively in high-performance applications such as inbound logistics, replenishment of picking stock, Goods to Person, Person to Goods, load consolidation/marshalling and further in the supply chain, parcel sortation. For all applications, Triton’s sub-millimeter repeat accuracy results in faster driving, faster docking and more effective fleet operation.

Mapping with SLAM: the first step to automating warehouse operations 22.02.2022 The e-commerce market has exploded in the past two years and is expected to quadruple by 2023. Warehouse operators are accelerating automation plans to leverage this stratospheric growth. And as they look to expand, they need solid technology platforms to give them a competitive advantage, starting with a mobile robot fleet and a mapped environment to guide those robots in their high-performance operations.
Figuratively speaking, to get anywhere, you need a map. This is literally true for mobile robots, and this is where SLAM comes in.
Simultaneous Localization and Mapping – or SLAM – is a method used to create a map of an environment while localizing a moving mobile robot in the environment at the same time. SLAM is a method, a system of components that requires an odometry source and a global perception system.
Accerion’s customers, including warehouse operators, e-commerce companies and manufacturers, use SLAM to create a map for their mobile robots and fleets for specific operations. This is to ensure a bounded global accuracy while mapping the floor in a large operational area.
There is a variety of tools available to create maps using SLAM. Operators mapping for the first time are free to choose any tools they wish in their SLAM application. Some use 2D Lidar, 3D Lidar, reflectors or cameras, depending on the type of map they wish to create. Warehouse operators often use Triton, Accerion’s localization system for mobile robots, to map their environments.
First, the floor is mapped using a mobile robot. As the floor is mapped, virtual lines of references from the existing floor surface are created by the Triton sensor.
What happens after mapping?
Mapping is the first step, and after the mapping is complete, you no longer need SLAM. All you need is Triton.
How does Triton work?
Consisting of an optical positioning sensor, an integrated processing unit and Accerion’s highly advanced algorithms, Triton localizes itself using the floor map, ensuring state-of-art repeatability in positioning.
Accerion uses computer vision so mobile robots operate accurately and reliably in high-performance intralogistics operations. Once the floor is mapped, the Triton sensor can do pure localization and provide pose corrections out of the box using only the floor.
By using vision to map the micro-texture landmarks of the existing warehouse floor, Triton measures pure displacement, allowing mobile robots to move with sub-millimeter accuracy at high speeds of 1.5 to 2 meters per second. Triton is extremely sensitive to the movement of the robot in any direction, which means it also works seamlessly in dynamic environments such as parcel sortation operations.
For the end-user, Triton is used effectively in high performance applications such as inbound logistics, replenishment of picking stock, Goods to Person, Person to Goods, load consolidation/marshalling and further in the supply chain, parcel sortation. For all applications, Triton’s sub-millimeter repeat accuracy results in faster AMR driving, faster docking and more effective fleet operation.
Triton turns mobile robots into high-performance, highly accurate and robust autonomous vehicles without infrastructure, and our low-cost hardware and powerful software bring flexibility and cost savings to the industry.
Accerion is not only accelerating industrial automation with our positioning technology, but we’re also setting the standard for mobile robot guidance.

Accerion selected to go on Dutch Boston Trade Mission with Prime Minister Rutte, other government officials 23.09.2019 There are stages startups and scale-ups go through on the way to becoming enduring companies.
At Accerion, we just reached an exciting stage with a new investment, new clients and new team positions.
But a trip to Boston from 17 through 19 July as part of a Dutch trade mission was a real milestone for us.
I represented Accerion on the trip, which included Prime Minister Mark Rutte and several special envoys from various Dutch industries, including our robotics and artificial intelligence sector.
Prime Minister Rutte attracts influential people, and in addition to government officials, the captains of Dutch industry, including top executives from NXP, Philips, Rabobank and Technical University of Eindhoven, we took part in the delegation with the goal of expanding the already strong business ties between the Netherlands and the United States.
Once we got to Boston, I started to understand what this market will mean for Accerion. We met some of the world’s most influential people at some of the world’s most impressive institutions including Harvard and Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
We also met with industry leaders, and I was super-impressed with the highly technologically advanced Boston Dynamics.
I’ve been in robotics for quite a while now. But during the Boston Dynamics visit … well, I’ve never seen anything as technologically impressive as the Atlas and Spot in real life.
We’ve all read about Atlas, Boston Dynamics’ latest humanoid robot, a 1.8-meter tall robot that has almost human movement capabilities.
And, of course, Spot is the famous agile and autonomous robot “dog” that we very much want for our Accerion office mascot. But to see their capabilities “in the flesh,” so to speak, was amazing.
https://accerion.tech/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Rutte-Boston-Dynamics.mp4 Other highlights included visits to: MassChallenge, a not-for-profit network of accelerators dedicated to supporting global entrepreneurship.
Mass Robotics, a collective of Boston-area engineers, rocket scientists and engineers who’ve created a robotics hub and startup center.
We already have customers in the States, so we definitely want to expand there. We are looking at how to do it THE RIGHT WAY. The Boston ecosystem in itself is incredibly important. There are a couple of extremely high-growth logistics companies that will likely be disruptive, including Locus Robotics, Vecna and 6 River Systems.
I think the rate of growth they achieved there is just incredible … and they’re brand new.
If you think about traditional automation companies, they’re going to have a really difficult time competing. What they offer in reliability they lose in speed.
The Americans raised the capital, perfected the technology and now they’re growing like crazy. Capital investment is increasing by perhaps 20 percent each year, but in the U.S., these guys are doing double, triple or quadruple.
What I found interesting is looking at what we do in the Netherlands compared to the U.S. In the first startup-to-scaleup phase – basically up to our phase – the Netherlands, a small country, competes 100 percent. The big difference is the next phase.
We’ll get our next financing for a few million. But in Boston, we were talking to these companies who had financing of upwards of $50 million. The expansion capital in the US … that’s where I think we lose. It makes me think, “Do we need to do something about that?” We’re looking for a big company we could partner with. That was a big positive … to connect with all these companies on the trip. We gained 25,000 views on the LinkedIn video by networking. An incredible number of people, including quite a CTOs and business-development executives, linked to me and said, “Let’s connect.” On the downside, it was a bit of show-and-tell and it was hard to get depth. So we’ll go back at end of 2019 or early 2020.
This was my first trade mission to the States, so I wasn’t sure what to expect. I can say one thing … it was very successful, with meetings with potential major market-leading clients you’ve heard of.

PAL Robotics and Accerion fighting COVID-19 in hospitals through DIH-HERO 06.07.2020 (Editor’s Note: This blog post was originally published on the PAL Robotics website June 17, 2020. It is reposted here with their permission.) TIAGo Delivery with the Jupiter and Triton sensors from Accerion will be used in this initiative With the unpredictable health crisis of COVID-19 continuing to place high demands on hospitals and healthcare institutions, there is a continuing search for better and more efficient solutions. This includes solutions that reduce time pressure on hospital staff, lessen the need for social interactions and lower the spread of infection.
In response to this ongoing need, PAL Robotics has developed a robotic solution for hospitals in partnership with Accerion , and we are excited to announce that it will go into deployment shortly.
PAL Robotics and project partner Accerion submitted a proposal to DIH Hero in response to their open Call, ‘Fighting COVID-19 2020 for healthcare robotics.’ The prototype solution for hospitals currently in development, is based on our TIAGo Delivery robot together with sensors provided by Accerion.
Who is the solution aimed at and what will it do?
TIAGo Delivery is aimed at hospitals keen to deploy autonomous vehicles due to the current situation that has increased their workload to unprecedented levels. The solution is also aimed at hospitals with a general interest in deploying Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) to reduce the need for medical staff to also do transportation and delivery tasks.
In addition to solutions to reduce interactions and stop the spread of COVID-19, there is also the ongoing requirement of delivering objects around hospitals, ranging from medication, to blood and medical samples, food, communications and instructions, and also surgical supplies. Even after COVID-19 becomes less of a risk, hospitals will still be able to use the TIAGo Delivery solution for deliveries.
The solution: TIAGo Delivery with sensors by Accerion The TIAGo Delivery solution is one of several solutions designed by PAL Robotics that can be easily integrated on top of the TIAGo Base robot.
TIAGo Delivery is an autonomous robot that delivers in a fast and safe way, thanks to its configuration. It can be used with shelves for transportation, or also extended with functionalities such as thermal cameras or other devices for monitoring patient’s health.
TIAGo Delivery is able to transport items around hospitals and has an even better accuracy in its positioning thanks to the cutting edge sensors by Accerion, reducing the deployment time of the whole solution.
When will TIAGo Delivery be used?
The steps to get the robot into hospitals include integration of the Accerion sensors on the TIAGo Delivery robot, development of the navigation system, and manufacturing and set up of the new robots.
The biggest advantage for hospitals is there is no need to change the hospital space. The solution can understand the commands of non-specially trained staff in the hospital, and comes with an easy-to-use user interface that enables users to select destinations for the robot to make deliveries or support communication.
DIH-HERO DIH-HERO launched this project and is an independent platform which connects Digital Innovation Hubs across Europe to create a sustaining network for all those who are active in the healthcare robotics sector. The project consortium consists of 17 core partners spread across 11 countries.
Meet DIH – HERO Core partners: Accerion PAL Robotics’ project partner, Accerion, provides positioning solutions, enabling high-performance mobile robots and AGVs for intralogistics, with virtual lines or grid mapping to allow for free navigation. In their portfolio are the Jupiter and Triton sensor systems, which can be quickly and easily integrated into robots and other mobile platforms to make them completely autonomous.
Jupiter, is Accerion’s advanced optical device, which scans the floor and creates a virtual line, navigating the mobile robot on simple or complex routes.

Eveline Wijnhoven: ‘I wanted to innovate with a diverse team. And then Accerion came along’ 14.03.2021 In the very competitive automation and mobile robotics sector, what’s true yesterday isn’t true tomorrow.
Accerion has to be flexible enough to change almost instantly. Everyone has to react to quickly changing market conditions, says Eveline Wijnhoven, Sales and Operations Coordinator . Eveline is a key player in the effort to bring not just new management systems and process coordination to Accerion, but new ways of thinking about the fundamentals of work.
Eveline arrived at Accerion more than equipped for the role, with a logistics and supply chain engineering degree and an impressive career resume with experience gained at multiple industries … at big companies and small, Dutch and American.
But two personal life events led directly to her new career. After starting a family, then experiencing a serious health scare, she found herself reflecting on what she really wanted out of her life and her career.
“What I decided is that I want to build something innovative with a strong, diverse team,” Eveline says. “And then Accerion came along.” At our maturing, fast-growing company, a lot depends on the Venlo native.
In her role as Sales and Operations Coordinator, Eveline is responsible for procurement, fulfillment, logistics, production planning and certain aspects of manufacturing. Oh, and she has to coordinate information flow between departments with many of her colleagues working remotely. And she has to get it all done in her 24-hour work week.
“With Corona, it’s really a challenge,” she says. But for more than a year, she’s been equal to that challenge.
After years at a variety of companies, including an American multinational, she’s bringing that depth of experience and extensive knowledge of sophisticated management and supply chain systems to her position.
Eveline sees her career at Accerion as a chance to not just realize her dream of working with cool people at an exciting company – it’s her opportunity to be part of a fundamental change in how people view work.
The aspirations of young talents have changed radically over the generations.
Her father worked to provide for his family, Eveline says. But in 2021, people come out of university “wanting to be valuable. And salary doesn’t mean that much anymore.” Young talents want to contribute to something bigger than just making money, she says. “They want to know why we’re doing this. And the reason we exist is, we make the future better” in many industries including fulfillment and warehousing.
“That’s the motivation of most of the people coming from school. You learn so much.
I have so much freedom at Accerion! So you can really explore yourself.” For Eveline, it all comes down to people.
“Because if you hire good people, then treat them well, they’ll reward your company with great work.” Her management philosophy of treating people well and making sure people feel good at work resulted in her initiating HR-related projects.
Within Accerion, you’re encouraged to suggest projects you believe will contribute to the benefit of all employees and the overall success of the company.
Eveline makes sure new colleagues have a soft landing with a fully effective onboarding process. In addition, she gave a boost to the vitality of the employees when she organized the “Steptember” team event last September. Teams signed up to put in at least 10,000 steps per day for the month of September while raising money for charity.
This was a fun event for employees to stay connected with each other while working remotely … all for a good cause.
“For me it’s all about connection.” Every one of the 20 Accerion employees “is giving all the energy they’ve got and all the knowledge they’ve got,” Eveline says. The trick, she adds, is knowing how to balance the go-go instincts of salespeople focused on selling and shipping and the engineering and production side, where process, quality and precision rule.
Which is exactly where Eveline Wijnhoven wants to be – in the middle of the action.

Amr Nahhas: Working as Customer Success Engineer at Accerion is an ‘absolute joy’ 13.01.2021 In the autonomous robotics space, talent is at a premium. Because not everyone can do what we do – build advanced robotic positioning technology, then help our customers make certain it achieves optimal performance.
Amr Nahhas, a native of Syria, just joined Accerion in October 2020. But in a way, he’s been preparing for the crucial role of Customers Success Engineer most of his life. Amr is not just an engineer with a master’s degree in mechatronics, robotics and automation engineering from the University of Siegen in Germany, he’s a multilingual – Arabic, English, German and Turkish – and multi-talented guy with that rare trait for an engineer … he’s great with people.
Which is why he’s Accerion’s Customer Success Engineer in this nuanced and crucial position that requires both engineering skills and people skills.
Customer Success Engineer: Unique role, unique circumstances As the name indicates, the Customer Success Engineer is responsible for making customers successful with Accerion’s products. That includes helping customers understand the different properties and choosing the best configuration; solving technical issues when integrating our technology into the customers AGVs and AMRs; and relaying customer feedback to team leaders in sales and marketing or development.
Starting a new job during the pandemic Amr had the unique experience of starting in the middle of a pandemic as a Customer Success Engineer for a company with a global customer base. He believes the pandemic actually unveiled Accerion’s flexibility and resilience.
Accerion team members, including Amr, now use digital platforms to communicate more efficiently, sharing documents, information and even code.
“As for my role as a Customer Success Engineer, I’m working mainly with other colleagues to solve technical problems remotely, i.e. by sending instructions to the customers to solve issues in the field,” he says. Many of the software-based problems can be resolved remotely.
“When we have a hardware issue, we try to work around this problem by requesting to have the item in the office instead of traveling to another country to solve that issue,” Amr said. “Customers understand that and always cooperate with us as they’re facing the same issues as a result of the pandemic.” Company culture: “Accerion is easy flow and trust” Despite the circumstances, the job is really fun, “and this is what I like the most about working at Accerion. I can describe it as fun, dynamic and ‘easy flow.’ This isn’t something I found in all the companies I worked with before.” His position as Customer Success Engineer requires a lot of responsibility and flexibility, which the company environment provides to encourage maximum innovation with minimal bureaucracy.
Early in Amr’s career, he said he experienced internal roadblocks to improvements and new ideas until the process eventually died. But this is not the case at Accerion.
“If you have an idea at Accerion, you bring it up in a meeting and colleagues say, ‘I like it’ or ‘I don’t like it.’ You directly know who’s going to be involved and you take it from there. You take on a small project and see how it goes from there. It’s really dynamic and it’s really ‘easy flow.’ ” Developing your skills Working at Accerion has also helped him to develop his people skills that engineers sometimes lack, as he believes: “ Actually, at one point of my life I wanted to join a company to improve this exact skill.” “If you’re looking for a place to develop yourself and get hands-on experience directly without any borders or obstacles, then Accerion is the right place for you.” “This is highly valued by me, because it’s not the case in every company, where they might say, ‘You’re not ready to go to that level.’ I really appreciate Accerion opening all doors for me and for saying, ‘Here, feel free to go wherever you want and learn whatever you need to.’ “In my opinion, trust is one of the main themes of Accerion’s working culture. This trust is really contagious. Being trusted by other team members, one can’t help but to trust everyone else back. This culture makes everyone relaxed and focused on doing the actual work in the most optimal way.” Real demanding, real fun Putting all his skills to work at Accerion in a flexible working environment has earned Amr a major career advancement “while having absolute joy at the same time,” Amr says.
“It’s really amazing how my skills are improving at a fast pace in Accerion. I can structure my day in the most efficient way to do my work and improve my skills in the best possible way.” Amr recommends Accerion without hesitation to other highly skilled internationals who are looking for the best place to develop skills and get hands-on experience while making an immediate impact in one of the most advanced engineering sectors.
Oh, and it’s a lot of fun as well.

Triton as Standalone Localization System Replacing navigation infrastructure by virtual lines or grid.
In manufacturing and e-commerce, many mobile robot solutions are based on fixed line or grid-based navigation. This is often achieved with QR tags, optical or magnetic tape, or reflectors. These systems depend on this external infrastructure, which is expensive to setup, change and maintain.
Accerion’s Triton offers a replacement solution that is fast to deploy, easy to change and robust. Triton can be used as a complete standalone localization solution to follow virtual lines or a virtual grid.
Fast deployment : commission entire factories in 2-3 days(!) Easy changes : change routing and layout without external experts Robust : recovery, automatic maintenance and performance monitoring As standalone system, this can be used in fenced applications such as Sortation or Goods-to-Person, or complimented by a separate safely system, like a low-cost safety lidar-based solution, for AGV and pallet transport.
The routes and grid can be designed completely free, with up to 40km in each standard Triton (custom solutions available on request).
In operation, each Triton continually updates the internal map, and monitors to ensure optimal performance of the vehicle.
How can Triton bring value to your business?
Faster Commissioning – Start Operation quickly Flexible – Easily change layout to adapt to business needs Robust Localization – Higher Throughput & Higher Uptime

With Triton onboard KUMATECH AGVs, companies can accelerate production automation plans 15.09.2021 Dutch Automated Guided Vehicle (AGV) manufacturer KUMATECH and Accerion have built a great partnership, helping Industry 4.0 companies accelerate production automation plans.
Who is KUMATECH?
Founded in 2017 by Kuunders Technoworks, KUMATECH initially developed and manufactured machines for sheet metal identification.
Then, more recently, they saw the need to make internal logistics easier for operators and added a line of affordable AGVs. These AGVs are specially designed for transport pallets, racks and trolleys for the manufacturing industry.
https://accerion.tech/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Tractor-Tom-AGV-MCM-Marknesse.mp4 How did KUMATECH and Accerion come together?
KUMATECH was searching for a simple and cost-effective solution for a line-following process for AGVs. Because production environments change regularly, easy implementation – without making architectural adjustments – was a key factor.
So, they contacted Accerion.
Accerion offered the early version of the Triton localization sensor, and, together, KUMATECH and Accerion developed a virtual line-following concept for quick AGV system deployment.
Industry 4.0 Characteristics of an Industry 4.0 operation include flexible machines, smaller series production and track and trace of products at various production steps, which are linked to the Enterprise Resource Planning system. KUMATECH’s AGVs facilitate this Industry 4.0 operation nicely.
The floor is your map KUMATECH fully developed their own line of AGVs specifically for process automation between the different steps in a production flow.
The objective was a quick system setup, which is where Accerion comes in with Triton localization sensors. This technology makes all the difference.
With Triton, the AGV follows a virtual line by scanning the floor. Triton offers 1-2 mm vehicle positioning repeat accuracy without any infrastructure.
Also, disturbances from a changing environment do not affect the Triton localization performance, which is a hurdle when using Lidar SLAM.
Throughout 2020, the Accerion engineering team continued to refine and prepare to launch Triton. During that time, the practical input from launching customer KUMATECH was valuable.
“I’m very impressed by the KUMATECH team. They saw an opportunity in their market and started developing, keeping the solution cleverly simple.” “Using virtual line-following, they have built a robust suite of AGVs that is set up in no time and provides immediate value to customers,” said Vincent Burg, CEO of Accerion.
In August 2021, KUMATECH has 10 operational sites using their AGVs, all using the Triton localization technology as the cost-effective and accurate solution required for the half-day system-setup at KUMATECH customer locations.
Now, when you buy a Tractor Tom from KUMATECH, it comes equipped with Triton, ready to guide your AGV autonomously throughout production and warehouse, moving pallets and rolling equipment easily with sub-millimeter localization input for accurate navigation and positioning.
Triton is the world’s first sub-millimeter-accurate and 100% infrastructure-free localization system for AGVs.
It requires no infrastructure, such as wires embedded in the floor, magnetic tape, QR markers or laser reflectors, making setup and route changes fast and easy.
Tractor Tom features: ✔️ Robust, modular vehicles ✔️ 1000 kg payload capacity ✔️ The latest Accerion sensor technology ✔️ Safety Scanner ✔️ Automatic charging The Tractor Tom is already an affordable solution, and Triton adds the finishing touch: virtual line-following with accurate navigation and positioning required for fast system setup.
Two companies came together to deliver a superior product.
This partnership shows the pandemic never stopped innovation … or that legendary Dutch collaboration.

Integrating Triton in Lidar-SLAM Bringing robustness and accuracy to Lidar-SLAM Lidar-SLAM is the most popular localization method for many mobile robots. It is fast to setup and offers free navigation using the safety lidar. However, lidar-SLAM solutions are well known for losing localization even in common environments in warehouses and factories. This leads to downtime and manual intervention. Also, in many cases additional systems are needed for docking since the lidar provides insufficient accuracy.
These limitations are caused by the working principle. Since it relies on a recognizing features in the environment using a laser scanner, these need to be clear and stable. However,  factories and warehouses often include: Dynamic environments : due to movement of people and material Lacking features: due to large open spaces or long aisles Slopes : to transition between floors Reflective surfaces: like glass walls This leads to robots losing localization and getting lost during operation which in turn causes downtime and reduces throughput.
How can we solve it?
Adding Triton to a Lidar SLAM solution adds another dimension, closing the robustness and accuracy gaps that are common today.
Since Triton uses the natural features of the floor to localize, this adds a robust data source to complement Lidar SLAM where it struggles to meet performance targets. This greatly improves reliability and performance of the mobile robot operation, leading to a smoother process and lower costs.
Triton can be used in switched or fused mode, depending on your needs and current system capabilities. Triton integrates easily with several commonly available Lidar SLAM solutions, including ROS AMCL, rtabmap, SICK Lidar-LOC, among others.

How will you benefit?
Robust in any environment – No more lost robots No human intervention – Higher efficiency Higher operational uptime – Happy customer

Automatica München – 6 halls of inspiring new robotics applications 25.06.2016 While the trip to München was long, the 6 halls filled with new and exciting robotics applications was absolutely worth it. In a day I was able to visit the 3 halls most relevant to Accerion and met many inspiring people showcasing their companies.
These halls were filled with robot arms, AGV, inspection equipment, large manufacturing setups and much more. The use of vision with robotic arms seemed to be driving a lot of clever solutions. One impressive solution was picking and placing rusty metal parts from a pile in a box, using 3D vision.
The range of innovative mobile solutions for manufacturing automation was amazing. In the attached picture I’ve included a few. There were a few clever small logistics AGV, enabling automation from a small scale in a factory. A research project by BA Systems et al for the PSA group enabled parts picking from a warehouse for automotive manufacturing, bringing the right parts to the right car on the production line. One project even aims to build a self-organising manufacturing plant using artificial intelligence.
Next Automatica München will be in 2 years, and I’m sure it will be worth the wait.

Accerion and Nobleo Technology develop the Plug & Play AGV 15.04.2020 In the logistics sector, more and more automation is being developed to increase productivity and reduce costs. More and more autonomous Vehicles (AGVs) are being used to automate logistics business processes where large distances are travelled. The first generation  AGVs  was bound by a physical infrastructure, such as magnets, radio beacons and/or lasers. The next-generation AGVs use advanced sensors and software to determine the relative movement compared to the floor and absolute location of the AGV.
However, this technology is still in its infancy and is custom-made. Business processes, building and flooring are designed around the AGVs, which requires technical operation support from the AGV supplier. Technical support comes at very high cost, making AGV solutions profitable only on a large scale. However, there is a sharp increase in demand for small-scale AGV solutions from the market for service robots that can carry out logistical work.
Accerion and Nobleo Technology will develop the Plug & Play AGV in this project: a physical box with hardware and software, which turns an electrically powered vehicle (EV) into an AGV, where the end user can quickly and independently configure the AGV in different environments and for different applications.
The project partners will develop a Plug & Play AGV box with hardware and software based on previously developed prototypes and Proofs-of-Concept: Plug & Play sensor box: Development of small and light box with sensors and software to accurately determine relative displacement for logistics & production automation on different floorings Automatic installation & configuration: Development of AGV platform (i.c.m. the sensor box) and user-friendly  interface for easy installation and configuration by end user Robust autonomy: Development of interference protocols so AGV can operate autonomously and without interaction with the end user Accerion (Venlo) and Nobleo Technology (Eindhoven) and will be able to provide the rapidly growing demand for profitable service robots with the development of the Plug & Play AGV.
Nobleo has a high demand for the self-developed AGV platform with sensor fusion: an AGV platform that processes data from different sensors into a generic control for the AGV. However, small-scale applications are not profitable, due to excessive manual installation and configuration costs. Accerion encounters the same problem with its own developed first-generation sensor box, which is also too large and heavy for usually light service robots.
With this cooperation project, these two relatively young companies from the TOPcluster HTSM can grow rapidly. They will unlock the new market of service robots, which can automate logistics work in different sectors.
This project will receive co-financing from the European Regional Development Fund within the framework of OPZuid.

Indoor navigation sensor (SLAM) The pandemic affected markets all over the world but perhaps none more dramatically than E-commerce, where we’ve seen a global shift from retail to online sales and home delivery. Now more than ever, Industry 4.0 companies need to automate – and scale quickly – to keep up with consumer demand and stay ahead of the competition. This explosive market growth accelerates the need to automate logistics operations on all levels.
We have a solution for high-performance mobile robot navigation.
It’s called Triton.
Indoor navigation Triton is the first 100% infrastructure-free localization sensor, which is seamlessly integrated in Autonomous Mobile Robot (AMR) navigation stacks and used in high-performance intralogistics operations. Triton is also easily merged with Automatic Guided Vehicles (AGV) navigation stacks and used for logistics, manufacturing and other warehouse applications.
Triton positioning system features sub-millimeter accuracy and is flexible and scalable. Perhaps its best feature – particularly for E-commerce applications – is Triton’s ability to work seamlessly in dynamic environments, busy warehouses where robots interact with each other and with humans.
AMR manufacturers use Accerion’s navigation sensor to build the highly dynamic and accurate positioning robots for their customers, the end-users automating warehouse operations.
How does Triton localize mobile robots in the environment?
Triton’s indoor navigation sensor scans the warehouse floor and creates “signatures.” These signatures are sent to the robot navigation stack, which the mobile robot uses to drive 100% autonomously.
Consisting of an optical sensor, an integrated processing unit, and Accerion’s algorithms, Triton scans the floor surface beneath robots and uses it as a reference. Triton uses the floor surface as a map to provide coordinates to the navigation system so robots can localize themselves in the environment. Your floor is literally Triton’s map, so there is no infrastructure required. No magnetic tape, no laser reflectors, no QR codes.
Triton sets a new standard in robot positioning for manufacturers and logistics operators who demand the highest degree of flexibility, adaptability, speed and precision and who want to create the warehouse of the future.

“Disinfection robots, cleaning robots, e-commerce delivery robots … I see a lot of opportunities” 06.07.2020 (Editor’s note: This post was originally published on EU-Startups.com and is reposted here with the author’s permission.) By Daria Kholod, EU-Startups Many industries have been impacted by the pandemic in one way or another. Food delivery apps have boomed, while ride-sharing services dropped by 70% in the past months . We have been wondering what has changed for the mobile robots and logistics sector. How did the increase in online shopping orders influence the logistics sector? Will mobile robots be used more because of the restrictive measures?
To find the answers to these and other questions, we spoke with Willem-Jan Lamers, founder of Accerion . Accerion (2015) is a Dutch company which produces localisation technology to enable mobile robots to become truly autonomous. We discussed with Willem-Jan the future of autonomous mobile robot sector, the effect of the pandemic on logistics and what makes Accerion localisation technology so unique.
First up, let’s start with the basics. How did you start Accerion and what is your mission with the mobile robot’s localisation technology?
It all started with an invention in my first company called Venamics in 2012. After 3 years of market research and development, we found the perfect fit for our technology in the mobile robotics market. It was then, in 2015 that Accerion was founded. In early 2016, my business partner Vincent Burg and our first employee Talha Ali Arslan joined me. We received our first investment which helped us to expand the team, develop the first products and attract customers. Last year we landed our Series A investment round and we grew the team to 20 people and 40 corporate customers all over the world.
The mission of Accerion is to make autonomous mobile robots 100% independent from infrastructure and give them the ability to operate in a flexible and dynamic environment, specifically in warehouse logistics and production automation. To make it happen, we developed a novel localization technology. It works with the use of cameras that look at the ground surface beneath the robots, using it as their reference. The floor is a static reference that does not change quickly, and by analysing the scans of the ground surface, the robots can localise themselves in the environment. This is what makes our approach so powerful and unique.
What are the principle markets you work with, and how have they been affected by the COVID crisis?
Our customers are autonomous robot manufacturers who, in turn, sell robots to the end user, mainly in logistics and production automation, but also in entertainment, agriculture and other adjacent markets. The principal market is indoor logistics and production automation. With regard to business activity, we are now almost back to the situation before the pandemic. We have clients from all over the world, including Europe (the Netherlands, Germany, Spain, Denmark), the US, China and India, who keep placing orders. Actually, the logistics sector has been booming at the moment and according to the analysts, the autonomous mobile robot market will grow faster that had been expected before the pandemic.
You work in the Netherlands where the restrictive measures were rather moderate compared to other European countries. How has the new business set up worked for Accerion?
Overall, the new business setup working remotely, was good for the company. To provide some context, our HQ is in Venlo, in the south of the Netherlands and when the Dutch government introduced the recommendations to work remotely in the middle of March, our team immediately took action and within one weekend, we adapted all the processes (including IT-related processes) to the new work-from-home environment. Regarding the general net effect on the business, I also noticed that the team became more efficient and focused working from home spending less time on travelling. However, the biggest drawback for us is the difficulty in meeting the customers face-to-face.
What are your predictions about the usage of mobile robots in the future, especially considering the ‘new normal’ setup?
I see a lot of opportunities in the current crisis for the growth of mobile robotics market. For instance, disinfection robots, cleaning robots, robots for logistics processes optimization, e-commerce delivery robots. I see a lot of opportunities in the area of disinfection robots linked to the current changes and shift to so-called ‘a high-mixed’ environment where robots and people work together with the goal to reduce tactile exposure of goods and robots with people. The e-commerce market has grown a lot – more goods are shipped door-to-door and most likely, this trend will continue.
What are the main challenges in the autonomous mobile robot sector?
Operations are becoming more flexible, dynamic, fast-paced. The currents trends include space optimization, products customization and goods diversification. All of that pose certain challenges to the logistics processes and requires a high degree of flexibility and adaptability. For the autonomous mobility sector, it means the increasing importance of an easy identification of the robot’s location and its complete independence from the environment.
What is your opinion on a common belief that robots are taking over the world and soon humans will be out of jobs?
It is funny how often this question pops up. In my view, this concern is absolute nonsense. It comes from the media and is based on the fear of new technologies. A century ago, people were afraid to switch from horses to cars and it seem to have worked quite well. So, there is nothing to be scared about. I believe that robots will take over the heavy, repetitive, ‘boring’ work which humans are not eager to do, such that they can focus on the interesting and more challenging work. For example, in many logistics applications it already becomes a requirement for robots to accomplish certain tasks because of the lack of the employees.
What advice would you give to early stage, European, tech startups right now?
Here are my 2 main recommendations: Validate your hypothesis about your product and its fit to the market. Build the smallest prototype to show it to your customers and validate it with them. Talk as much as you can with your potential customers, preferably doing it face-to-face. Tune your product in to the market. Listen to them. Be as lean as possible.
Focus. Focus on the market you want to address and the product you are developing. There will always be tremendous opportunities popping up around you. The biggest mistake most entrepreneurs make is diving into every opportunity that arises. I recommend not to be distracted by new opportunities which make you deviate from your path. Focus on one task and keep working on it.

Want to know what it’s really like working at Accerion? Let’s ask Systems Developer Talha Ali Arslan.
28.09.2022 In the first month he joined what was then only a promising robotics positioning startup, Accerion took the young engineer to an innovation and technology trade fair, then put him on stage when Accerion received the innovation award. Then, the emcee asks him what he thinks about robots taking over jobs of people.
In Dutch, which he couldn’t speak or understand at the time.
He repeated the question to Talha in English: “Do you think it is a problem that your technology will make a couple of people unemployed?” “So, I needed to come up with an answer very quickly. My answer was, ‘No, I don’t think so, because with the advances in these types of technologies, there will be more jobs in new fields for people to work on. I think these can actually improve working conditions of some people, while creating opportunities and openings in new fields too.’ “Now I wonder at how many companies would you have the chance to go with the founders, then end up on stage accepting an innovation award in your first month?” “It’s rare, I would say.” And then there was that time Accerion founder Willem-Jan Lamers handed him one of the early Accerion positioning modules along with a bunch of components and told Talha, “Okay, here is the prototype. Here are the parts for the second one. The second one will go to the first pilot customer. Can you assemble the second one looking at the first one?
Okaay.
“It was like IKEA … like an IKEA assignment without any instructions, and on top of that, I had to assemble some electrical and optical components, which I have seen for the first time in my life.” Talha says. But it was also indicative of how much faith Accerion management has in his skills.
“They trusted me, based on the fact that I was a generalist engineer interested in hands-on things,” Talha says. “So, I should be able to do that; take apart the first prototype without permanently damaging anything, put it back together properly and then assemble our second working prototype.” If anyone is going to survive this kind of creative whirlwind startup, it’s going to be him. That Accerion chose this robotics fanatic – and he chose an advanced robotics positioning company – was destiny. Both have advanced far faster from the symbiotic energy.
Since 2016, Talha has witnessed Accerion go from Version 1.0 of the company, a young, ambitious startup, to a fast-growing tech company with 20+ employees; a company that’s expanding globally in a very advanced robot positioning niche.
Triton, the company’s latest positioning system for mobile robots, consists of an optical positioning sensor, an integrated processing unit and advanced algorithms. Triton uses the warehouse floor as a map to provide coordinates to the navigation system so robots can localize themselves in the environment, ensuring state-of-art repeatability in positioning. Triton turns mobile robots into high-performance, highly accurate and robust autonomous vehicles without infrastructure.
“Using only the existing floor surface to localize with sub-mm repeatability and to do this without infrastructure is a game changer. With an infrastructure-less positioning system like ours, the scale of required investment to adopt robotics and automation gets within reach of businesses with any size.” Turns out he was as well prepared for the ride as anyone could have been.
Born in Turkey, Talha went to Robert College in Istanbul for high school, mastering English along the way. Following his bachelor study at Boğaziçi University in Istanbul, he ended up at Technical University of Eindhoven because he wanted to study control and robotics.
Talha relaxes by – you guessed it – exploring new technologies through hobby projects. He’s always been like that, which is what led him to Accerion.
Talha was considering positions through Nobleo, a tech recruitment firm in Eindhoven. Working though the placement agency, he could work on different projects and not get bogged down in a corporate routine. Those Nobleo contacts told him about Accerion, “they’re looking for someone like you and you have our blessing. If you want, you can talk to them directly.” So, he meets Willem-Jan Lamers and Vincent Burg, now Accerion’s CEO, through Nobleo, joining the startup in April 2016.
Working at Accerion has meant non-stop skills acquisition in computer vision, indoor localization, robotics, system integration, design and architecture, Talha says. In the past years, he’s learned a lot from customers. “That’s why I suggest new hires join the Customer Success Engineering team or visit customers occasionally, so they work directly on the field and experience the real use cases first-hand,” he says.
Customers are happy to give performance feedback and are NOT worried about hurting your feelings. The fact that he previously only had a background in robotics and control systems via research institutes and universities didn’t stop him from working with suppliers and customers to integrate, test, to trouble-shoot issues such as software bugs and to tweak and assess products.
“And that openness and honesty are also very useful for you to develop and fix the problems with the product that you’re offering them,” Talha says.
In fact, early on, the way prospective customers at industrial shows and trade fairs engaged with Accerion technology convinced Talha that Accerion was for real and there was a career here. “The fact that people were getting fixated on this sensor … playing with it and trying to mess with it,” he says. “Trying to put their hands or feet under the sensor to see if it would fail … that gave me more and more motivation to take this to the next step.” Having Accerion on his resumé as Employee No. 1 is a great boost, Talha says. It makes him “an independent creator of new products and features,” which include hardware and software.
Developing vision, robotics and positioning systems has made him confident he can tackle any technical issues he’s given, he said, even if it’s outside his field of expertise.
“Accerion and our customers have provided me with enough problems and space to get to know myself professionally. It is not only a joy to be creating novel technical solutions and seeing them in action so quickly; it is also a great enabler to be aware of your strengths and skills to improve. And you get to go through this journey with a great group of people.” previous article Triton’s Texture Vision Technology enables high-performance mobile robot operations next article Accerion Teams Up with SICK to combine Triton with SLAM Links: Triton’s Texture Vision Technology enables high-performance mobile robot operations -> https://accerion.tech/news/tritons-texture-vision-technology-enables-high-performance-mobile-robot-operations/ Accerion Teams Up with SICK to combine Triton with SLAM -> https://accerion.tech/news/accerion-teams-up-with-sick-to-combine-triton-with-slam/

Norman Nieder-Heitmann: From specialist engineer to business developer – full flexibility at Accerion 30.06.2021 When South African native Norman Nieder-Heitmann was building on his engineering background and looking for a more customer-facing role, Accerion encouraged him to play to his strengths.
With a degree in Industrial Engineering from Stellenbosch University near Cape Town, Norman has made the shift from specialized engineering into a fully customer-facing business development role.
Norman worked at a packaging automation equipment company in South Africa and enjoyed the innovative and entrepreneurial spirit of the company. It informed his way of thinking. He was looking for a company with a similar culture when he came to the Netherlands.
So, he crafted a description of what he really wanted to do – sales but with technical products, a “sales engineer” – then began searching for the right opportunity. He found it at Accerion, a fast-growing company providing a unique positioning technology for mobile robots.
What really attracted him to Accerion was the innovative products and the dynamic entrepreneurial spirit of the company.
This is a pivotal time at Accerion, he notes, as the company grows into a global firm.
Flexibility, growth and impact It’s also a time of greater flexibility in roles. Putting the right person in the right position for optimal impact isn’t always obvious. If an employee starts at Accerion as a developer but has the potential to work directly with clients, they have an opportunity to move into a more customer-facing role that still draws on their technical expertise, Norman notes.
“There are a lot of growth opportunities at Accerion. You can gain knowledge through experience and also grow into a role that fits you well. There’s that flexibility here to find your feet,” says Norman.
Making an impact is the essence of Accerion, he added. “You start with ‘why … why does Accerion exist?’ I think it has a lot to do with Vincent (Burg) as a person, his way of thinking.” Vincent, CEO, and founder Willem-Jan Lamers set out to solve a problem, Norman says, “but it’s also a personal thing. I’ve seen they have a hunger for creating something unique and then push themselves and learn … learn more about what it is they can do with their lives and their time. They want to work with people with like-minded vision and personal growth plans. They want them on their team.
“It’s a very personal mission.” To complete that mission, everyone brings their whole selves to work and pitches in to work on core responsibilities.
“There’s a little bit of magic with Accerion. You’re not employed as a resource; you’re employed as a person with talents,” Norman says.
“Accerion knows that if they have the right people, the results will come.” For a young company (founded in 2015), Accerion has gained significant traction in the market. That’s the technical side. For anyone joining the company, “it’s growing and evolving and is very dynamic,” Norman says.

Warehouse operators accelerate automation plans to keep up with consumer demand 22.09.2021 Experts in the logistics and supply chain industry know that while 2020 was an extraordinary year with huge obstacles to overcome, it was also part of a larger pattern that had been building as consumers increasingly purchased online.
The mounting pressure behind promises of faster, cheaper shipping and more consumer purchasing power exploded into the public eye last year leading those on the outside to believe this was a one-off event and would simmer down to more “normal levels” as soon as the health crisis eased.
For logistics and shipping professionals, we know this was an unpredictable catalyst that has now moved supply chain challenges to another level – perhaps permanently – as the “new normal” shifts to include more online shopping.
How then do retailers, warehouses and logistics providers stay on top of the curve and, hopefully, move beyond trends into proactive B2B solutions?
As Goods to Persons logistics companies look to expand, they need solid technology platforms to build upon so they don’t just keep up with demand but move ahead of the competition.
The current solutions are more than trends. They are the new building blocks to faster and more efficient warehousing, giving employees more flexibility to react faster to evolving business needs.
We have outlined the two most important new technology and automation solutions we see will give Goods to Person companies the edge they need.
Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) A new generation of mobile robot has arrived, working alongside the industry standard Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs).
Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) can drive regular routes throughout warehouse floors without the need for external or specially built infrastructure systems to support them.
Even more important than previous generations, AMRs can adapt to rapidly changing and dynamic work environments thanks to onboard navigation systems and localization technology such as Accerion’s Triton system.
These key differentiators make AMRs the most urgent upgrade to autonomous Goods to Person systems in years.
In fact, according to Interact Analysis , industry ordering records show that “nearly 20,000 AMRs for use in fulfillment supporting order picking were shipped in 2019, double the number shipped the previous year and more than doubling the total number of AMRs in use.” AMRs provide the flexibility and scalability operators need so they can quickly realize a return on their investments.
Warehouse Automation With more and more consumers moving their purchasing power online, logistics and supply chains are feeling the pressure to deliver shipping timeline promises of retailers.
A recent study found that “in 2015, five-day delivery for the average online consumer order was standard; in 2019, it moved to two days.” In Goods to Person markets, this is surely felt along all points on supply chains. To help keep up with demand, warehouse technologies are becoming more automated wherever possible while keeping workers in supervisory positions on their toes to ensure smooth warehouse operations.
AMRs also find their place in these automated warehouses, integrating seamlessly in existing physical structures without needing new infrastructure to support them.
According to a November 2020 Conveyco article , “Forty-one percent of consumers are willing to pay a charge for same-day delivery while nearly a quarter (24%) of shoppers said they would pay more to receive packages within a one- or two-hour window of their choosing.” This changes everything.
Warehouse automation needs to keep pace with consumer demand as it continues to shoot skyward and shipping times become shorter.
There is good news, though, and this is where Accerion comes in.
Triton is the world’s only 100% infrastructure-free localization technology for mobile robots. Triton enables AMRs to drive autonomously in the warehouse, solving several challenges with one compact, affordable product.
How does Triton work?
Triton localization systems for AMRs are infrastructure-free, so there are no embedded guiding wires, no QR codes, no extra features for Lidar.
Triton enables AMRs to follow a virtual grid with sub-millimeter accuracy, operating seamlessly in dynamic environments at a speed of 1.5 to 2 meters per second.
Accerion’s positioning system ticks off all the boxes for logistics operators – especially Goods to Person – who want to accelerate automation.
Last but not least, Triton is economical. Triton’s dynamic and accurate vehicle operation means operators can do more with fewer AMRs, significantly reducing costs.
Triton is the right technology at the right time to further accelerate industrial automation, giving Goods to Person logistics operators a competitive advantage.

Accerion closes Series A investment; plans major expansion 21.05.2019 Accerion closes Series A investment; plans major expansion Funding coincides with exponential sales growth Venlo, Netherlands – Accerion has closed its Series A funding round as it prepares to enter new global markets while expanding its team.
Accerion’s A round is backed by Phoenix Contact Innovation Ventures, a Blomberg, Germany-based corporate venture capital investor, in syndication with LIOF, the economic development agency for the Limburg Province of the Netherlands.
The tech startup’s positioning technology integrates into new or existing equipment such as forklifts, industrial vehicles and mobile logistics robots, enabling them to perform functions autonomously and with extreme precision even in dynamic environments.
The technology needs no special infrastructure. Instead, Accerion’s proprietary intelligent algorithms combined with advanced camera technology not only “learn” the floor as the only directional reference but collaborates with other vehicles. “Your floor is our map,” is the Accerion motto.
“Autonomous guided vehicles (AGVs) and mobile robots are key enablers for full automation in manufacturing and logistics,” said Marcus Böker, Managing Director of Phoenix Contact Innovation Ventures.
“For instance, the reduction of manual material handling in production lines is a main goal within the manufacturing industry, but this can only be partly addressed by existing technologies. Accerion’s technology allows AGVs and mobile robots to really navigate infrastructure-free by achieving far more accuracy than traditional infrastructure-based solutions.” “Accerion is perfectly positioned for accelerated growth in the booming market of logistics robotization and automation through its game-changing positioning technique in combination with a smart, experienced and dedicated team,” said Gaby Zandbergen, Investment Manager at LIOF, Rapid global adoption Globally, the market for mobile robots is forecast to grow by double-digits with an expected valuation of more than 10 billion euros by 2025.
“The key objective is to get Accerion’s technology to the right customers: logistics automation companies who are building industry-leading solutions, and therefore need the latest, high-performance positioning technology,” said Vincent Burg, managing director.
“It’s amazing to see Accerion, its team and customer base grow exponentially over the years,” said Willem-Jan Lamers, founder. “This investment allows us to accelerate our developments and market adoption even faster.” The investment comes at a time when Accerion is experiencing exponential growth in revenue and order flow for its Jupiter and Triton packages, with customers in the European Union, the United States, China and India.  Accerion will use this significant capital injection to scale up production and nearly double its team as the firm competes for a larger share of the global logistics, warehousing and fulfillment market.
The fact that Phoenix Contact – both the venture fund and the parent industrial group, which reported 2.4 billion euros in 2018 turnover – is backing Accerion is a game-changing endorsement from an international automation-engineering leader.
Burg credited Phoenix and LIOF with sharing Accerion’s vision and goals: “Throughout the investment process, everything was geared toward the growth of our company.” About Accerion: Accerion is a Netherlands-based tech startup founded in 2015 by Willem-Jan Lamers. Led by Willem-Jan Lamers and Vincent Burg, Accerion has developed 100-percent infrastructure-free positioning technology for mobile robots that uses the floor as a reference.

The Scout robot – Rapid progression and  fast actions 13.02.2019 Demand for extremely fast set-up times? No problem, the new addition to the Accerion family makes customer´s  life easier.
The Scout robot is developed to support mobile robots that use Accerion positioning sensors in the mapping phase, decreasing setup times dramatically. Assisting this even for large buildings, we invented the Scout. The Scout is a small robot, containing a Jupiter and a Hokuyo lidar. The highly accurate Jupiter data supercharges the lidar mapping, which is then used as starting point for Jupiter absolute mapping.
Thanks to talented students of Fontys Hogeschool Eindhoven, who developed the hardware, electronics and industrial design of the robot, the project was realized in only four month. We think it is an amazing result and great support for Accerion during in-plant implementation. The Scout benefits customers satisfaction and is available soon.

Accerion product development: Triton update includes new and improved features 08.03.2021 In the tech world – especially in autonomous robotics – there’s no such thing as resting on your laurels after a successful product launch. At Accerion, improvement is continuous.
In September, we launched Triton , a new localization sensor for mobile robots and automated guided vehicles (AGVs).
Triton sets the new standard in positioning for manufacturers and logistics operators who demand the highest degree of flexibility, adaptability, speed and precision.
https://accerion.tech/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Triton-Unboxing.mp4 Triton’s new features include greater precision Since we introduced our Triton positioning technology in September, we never stopped listening to customers and learning how they use Triton in their high performance operations.
Our team is testing and refining our products every day. Using customer input and our own research, we’ve made several crucial improvements, including new features and even greater precision.
For the autonomous mobile robot sector, easily and accurately determining the robot’s location – independent from the environment – is essential, specifically in warehouse logistics and production automation.
Consisting of an optical sensor, an integrated processing unit, and Accerion’s algorithms, Triton scans the floor surface beneath robots and uses it as a reference. Triton uses the floor surface as a map to provide coordinates to the navigation system so robots can localize themselves in the environment.
Triton’s infrastructure-free localization technology with sub-millimeter-level accuracy gives mobile robots the ability to perform precision work in dynamic environments.
There are no lasers, no magnetic tape, no QR codes. Just the Triton and your floor.
New features: Floor Qualifier, G2O, Idle Mode “We’ve added a floor qualifier function to the newest generation of sensor,” says Jordan Fryers, Business Development Manager. The floor qualifier is used to assess the performance of Triton on a floor type.
With the push of a button and a short sampling of the floor, the floor qualifier function analyzes the localization “fingerprints” – unique surface features Triton tracks and maps – of floors at four different speeds, Jordan says. It then gives a floor rating based on how easy it was for Triton to identify floor markers.
“The floor qualifier function was developed internally for our customer success team, but it’s proven so valuable we’re making it available on Tritons for every customer,” he says.
There’s more … “ Customers can enhance their maps using Pose Graph Optimization (PGO) Software. Triton now supports the widely accepted exchange file format G2O.
Via the API, ROS Node or the Accerion graphic interface, this file can be exported and, after optimization by the customer, imported,” Jordan says.
This technology gives the client the ability to optimize their maps and use image analysis to eliminate drift with incredible accuracy.
Finally, we’ve introduced an idle mode that reduces owner consumption.
The software can now go into a 6-watt idle mode from 15 watts, using 60 percent less power in idle mode.
Since 2015, Accerion has been perfecting localization technology for mobile robots and AGVs. Accerion’s mission is to make autonomous mobile robots 100% independent from infrastructure and operate with high precision in a flexible, dynamic environment.
