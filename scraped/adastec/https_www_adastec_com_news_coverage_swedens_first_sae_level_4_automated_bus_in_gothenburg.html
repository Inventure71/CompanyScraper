Slated to commence passenger service in August 2025, this deployment marks a transformative milestone for Sweden’s urban transit landscape, combining enhanced automated driving technology with real-world transportation needs.</p><h2><strong>A Milestone for ADASTEC and Sweden</strong></h2><blockquote>Dr. Ali Peker, CEO of ADASTEC, commented, “It is a great honor to deliver Sweden’s first SAE Level-4 automated public transport bus in collaboration with Västtrafik, Vy Buss, Karsan, and Applied Autonomy. Nearly three years ago, we achieved a world first in Europe and the United States by deploying SAE Level-4 automated buses carrying ticketed passengers on open public roads. Today, we continue to provide sustainable and accessible transport solutions, with our automated buses operating in cities across Europe and the United States. This project reflects our commitment to shaping a more sustainable and connected urban mobility landscape.”</blockquote><blockquote>The Gothenburg project demonstrates ADASTEC’s expertise in advancing public transportation with factory-fitted Karsan Autonomous e-Atak buses automated by ADASTEC’s flowride.ai software. This technology integrates seamlessly with urban transit systems, creating more inclusive and connected cities. “We are proud to support sustainable transportation solutions that enhance communities and drive innovation,” said Dr. Peker.</blockquote><h3><strong>Connecting Gothenburg’s Central Hub to the Gårda District</strong></h3><p>The driverless bus will operate on a 5-kilometer route, connecting Gothenburg’s Central Station to Liseberg Station, while serving seven strategically located stops in the Gårda district. This initiative is a result of close collaboration between Västtrafik, the region’s public transit authority, and Vy Buss, the bus operator, with funding from the Västra Götaland region.</p><blockquote>Kai Roger Kristoffersen, Project Manager at Vy Buss, explained: “Next year, Västtrafik and Vy Buss plan to test a large self-driving bus in regular service in central Gothenburg. If everything goes according to plan and the necessary permits are granted, this will be the first time in Sweden that a full-sized autonomous bus is tested in dense urban traffic. The bus is eight meters long, accommodates 52 passengers, and will operate at the same speed as other traffic. It will run on a route of approximately 5 km, serving seven stops. The project is a collaboration between Västtrafik, Vy Buss, Karsan, Applied Autonomy, ADASTEC, and the City of Gothenburg.”</blockquote><h3><strong>Building on ADASTEC’s Legacy</strong></h3><p>ADASTEC’s deployments across Europe and the U.S. underscore the reliability of its automated solutions in challenging environments, including 800-meter tunnels in Norway and Finland’s icy winters. The Gothenburg deployment further cements ADASTEC’s reputation as a leader in automated transit.</p><blockquote>Dr. Peker explained, “Our work in Gothenburg builds on a legacy of successful deployments, including operations at Michigan State University, the first automated bus project at Rotterdam Airport, and Finland’s harsh winter conditions. These projects highlight our mission to advance urban mobility, reduce carbon emissions, and improve accessibility.”</blockquote><h4><strong>Driving Sustainability and Inclusion</strong></h4><p>As a factory-fitted, SAE Level-4 automated bus, the Karsan Autonomous e-Atak demonstrates the potential of intelligent transit solutions to reduce emissions, improve accessibility, and revolutionize urban mobility. &quot;Collaborating with ADASTEC and Karsan enables us to deliver enhanced technology through the flowride.ai platform, ensuring seamless integration into real-world operations. This partnership paves the way for the future of public transportation in Sweden, combining safety, efficiency, and automation,” said Olav Madland, CEO of Applied Autonomy.</p><p>ADASTEC’s commitment to sustainable, inclusive transportation is central to this project. By providing a reliable, eco-friendly service, this deployment underscores ADASTEC’s vision of creating smarter, more connected cities. “Our partnership with Karsan spans many years, and their role in this deployment reaffirms the importance of strong collaborations for successful automated bus operations,” Dr. Peker emphasized.</p><blockquote>Karsan CEO Okan Baş stated, <strong>&quot;Karsan Autonomous e-ATAK, our first Level-4 autonomous bus carrying ticketed passengers in open traffic in Norway and Finland, will now break new ground in Sweden&#x27;s public transportation. To date, we have gained a great deal of experience with the 100,000 kilometers we have covered and the 35,000 passengers we have transported with our autonomous vehicle. This experience and the feedback we receive from our customers enable us to produce more innovative solutions every day and to continuously go further by breaking our limits. We will continue to shape the future by reinforcing our leadership in the sector of autonomous technology.&quot;</strong></blockquote><p>‍</p><p>This project is a significant milestone for public transportation in Sweden, showcasing the benefits of factory-fitted automated buses equipped with ADASTEC’s flowride.ai. It exemplifies ADASTEC’s ability to deliver scalable, flexible, and sustainable solutions tailored to the specific needs of cities worldwide.</p><p>‍</p></div></div><script src="https://d3e54v103j8qbb.cloudfront.net/js/jquery-3.5.1.min.dc5e7f18c8.js?site=600ad06ae00a6210fd3a2752" type="text/javascript" integrity="sha256-9/aliU8dGd2tb6OSsuzixeV4y/faTqgFtohetphbbj0=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600ad06ae00a6210fd3a2752/js/webflow.8c2250f2.381e556a8c746557.js" type="text/javascript"></script></body></html>
