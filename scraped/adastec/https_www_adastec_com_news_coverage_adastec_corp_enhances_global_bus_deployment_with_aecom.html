This collaboration marks a significant advancement in ADASTEC&#x27;s mission to tackle the challenges modern cities face, such as traffic congestion, carbon emissions, and the need for accessible transportation. </p><p>With a solid commitment to innovation and quality, ADASTEC integrates AECOM&#x27;s AV-Readi<strong>®</strong> tool into their deployment strategy. This tool offers insights into the feasibility of automated vehicle (&quot;AV&quot;) routes and identifies potential barriers to AV adoption. This integration allows ADASTEC to significantly streamline its deployment process, as it can now virtually assess site readiness across various continents without the necessity of a physical presence. This capability is vital as ADASTEC aims to scale up operations and increase the adoption rate of automated buses globally.</p><blockquote>Dr. Ali Peker, Chief Executive Officer of ADASTEC, emphasizes the transformative nature of this partnership: <em>&quot;ADASTEC&#x27;s core vision is to provide advanced automated public transport solutions that are efficient and environmentally responsible. Collaborating with AECOM and adopting their AV-Readi™ tool is a quantum leap in our deployment agility. Now, we can swiftly identify the best routes and prepare for deployments across the globe, from the bustling streets of North America to the diverse terrains of Europe and Australia, without stepping foot on site.&quot;</em></blockquote><blockquote>AECOM&#x27;s automation and data technical lead, Paul Avery, said, <em>&quot;Working with an innovative and agile company like ADASTEC is a pleasure and has allowed AECOM to explore new applications for our AV-Readi assessment tool. With deployments across the U.S. and Europe, we have a great opportunity to collaborate and bring safe, capable automation to the transit world.&quot;</em></blockquote><p><em> </em></p><p>The AV-Readi tool offers a sophisticated analysis of the readiness of roadways for automated vehicles, which is essential for ADASTEC as they push forward with their <a href="https://www.adastec.com/post/overcoming-deployment-hurdles" target="_blank">automated bus deployments</a>. This tool ensures that ADASTEC&#x27;s electric public transit buses, equipped with their proprietary SAE Level-4 automated driving software platform, flowride.ai, can operate successfully in various urban environments. </p><blockquote>Cemre Kavvasoğlu, Product Management Director at ADASTEC North America, commented: &quot;At ADASTEC, we are thrilled to announce our partnership with AECOM and adopting their AV-Readi™ tool for our global automated bus deployment projects. Leveraging AECOM&#x27;s extensive expertise and the robust analysis capabilities of AV-Readi™, we are confident that our customers will benefit from objective and sophisticated site assessments, further enhancing the success of our deployments worldwide.&quot;</blockquote><p>‍</p><blockquote>AECOM&#x27;s Global Lead of Connected and Automated Technology, Suzanne Murtha, said: &quot;This partnership with ADASTEC will prove transformational for the AV-Readi tool, which has already supported thousands of miles of automated vehicle routing analysis for numerous global infrastructure owners and operators. We couldn&#x27;t be prouder to collaborate with a leader in AV software to accelerate the deployment of automated vehicles globally.&quot;  </blockquote><p>As ADASTEC continues to work with OEMs and infrastructure operators worldwide, this partnership with AECOM reinforces their leadership in the autonomous commercial vehicle market. It affirms ADASTEC&#x27;s commitment to delivering high-quality transportation solutions to communities everywhere.</p><p>  </p><p><strong>About ADASTEC Corp.</strong> </p><p>ADASTEC Corp. is a pioneering software company advancing autonomous and connected public transportation vehicles.
