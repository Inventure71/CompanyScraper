This deployment underscores ADASTEC’s global leadership in innovative and sustainable urban mobility solutions.</p></div><div class="news-post-body text-try w-richtext"><h1><strong>ADASTEC Deploys the First “Automated Public Transport Bus” in Switzerland, Enhancing Connectivity in Arbon</strong></h1><p>‍</p><p><strong>Arbon, Switzerland</strong> – ADASTEC, a leading software company specializing in SAE Level-4 automated driving software solutions, is proud to announce the deployment of its advanced automated bus in Arbon, Switzerland. This project, called SCCL (Self Controlled City Liner), initiated by TGA, the Technical Society of Arbon, and carried out in collaboration with Karsan, represents a significant milestone in developing innovative urban mobility solutions. The deployment of SCCL project aims to revolutionize public transportation by integrating SAE Level-4 automated driving technology with the city&#x27;s existing infrastructure.</p><blockquote><strong>Ali İhsan Danısman, Chief Commercial Officer of ADASTEC,</strong> commented on this achievement: &quot;Deploying Karsan Autonomous e-Atak in Arbon, marks another milestone in our commitment to advancing public transportation. Following our successful deployments in Finland, Rotterdam, Norway, and other locations across Europe with Karsan, we are happy to extend our impact to Switzerland. The dedication of Eurobus as the bus operator and TGA as the project owner has been key to making this deployment a reality.&quot;</blockquote><p>This initiative will see Karsan Autonomous e-Atak bus seamlessly connect key areas within Arbon, including the historic old town and the newly developed Saurer Werk 2 district. The city of Arbon has a long tradition in the development and construction of trucks and public transportation buses with the famous SAURER company. The project reflects that tradition and enhances the city’s transportation network and serves as a model for how advanced automation can be harmonized with urban areas&#x27; unique cultural and architectural heritage.</p><p><strong>EUROBUS Ostschweiz AG</strong> will oversee the operation of the automated bus along a carefully planned 2.2 km route that features eight strategically located stops: from the train station along the shore of Lake Constance and the Medieval Castle through the old town to the public swimming pool and the city hall back to the train station. The bus will navigate the narrow, winding streets of Arbon’s old town, which are known for their historical significance and charm, at a controlled speed limit of 30 km/h. This careful consideration ensures that the introduction of automated technology complements the existing environment, delivering a transportation service that is both efficient and respectful of the city’s unique character.        </p><blockquote><strong>Hansueli Bruderer, Project Manager SCCL at TGA,</strong> emphasizes the importance of this deployment: &quot;Bringing ADASTEC&#x27;s automated bus into Arbon&#x27;s public transportation system is a significant step toward sustainable and innovative urban mobility. We are excited to see this technology enhance the connectivity within our city while respecting and preserving its historical heritage. Of particular interest is the equipment of a high-tech workstation for remote monitoring and remote control of the automated bus at Eurobus&#x27; headquarters.”</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Okan Baş, Chief Executive Officer of Karsan, added:</strong> “Our vehicle, with its compact structure perfectly suited to the narrow streets of Arbon, promises passengers a comfortable and environmentally friendly automated travel experience while preserving the historical fabric of the city. We are proud to play a pioneering role in Switzerland&#x27;s transition to automated driving public transportation with the Autonomous e-Atak, which will carry passengers along a 2.2-kilometer public transport route.”</blockquote><p>This deployment not only reinforces ADASTEC’s position as a leader in automated driving technology but also exemplifies its commitment to pioneering the future of public transportation on open public roads. Just as ADASTEC has successfully integrated its technology across diverse environments in Europe and the United States, this project in Switzerland further demonstrates its ability to harmonize advanced automation with the unique demands of both historical and modern urban areas. As ADASTEC continues to deploy its solutions globally, the company remains dedicated to advancing the safety, efficiency, and sustainability of public transit, ensuring that cities around the world are ready for the next generation of mobility.</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p></div></div><script src="https://d3e54v103j8qbb.cloudfront.net/js/jquery-3.5.1.min.dc5e7f18c8.js?site=600ad06ae00a6210fd3a2752" type="text/javascript" integrity="sha256-9/aliU8dGd2tb6OSsuzixeV4y/faTqgFtohetphbbj0=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600ad06ae00a6210fd3a2752/js/webflow.8c2250f2.381e556a8c746557.js" type="text/javascript"></script></body></html>
