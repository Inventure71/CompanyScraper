ADASTEC&#x27;s SAE Level-4 automated driving software platform is designed to operate efficiently even in Finland&#x27;s challenging winter conditions. The project underscores ADASTEC&#x27;s commitment to enhancing urban mobility with sustainable and reliable automated transport solutions.</p></div><div class="news-post-body text-try w-richtext"><h1>ADASTEC, Karsan, and Applied Autonomy Launch Automated Bus in Finland&#x27;s Winter</h1><p>Tampere, Finland – ADASTEC, a leading software company specializing in SAE Level-4 automated driving software solutions, in collaboration with Karsan, Applied Autonomy, and Finnish transport company REMOTED, has proudly announced the deployment of the Karsan autonomous e-ATAK bus in Tampere, Finland. The operations represent an integral part of the SHOW initiative — the EU&#x27;s most extensive effort to foster sustainable transport solutions in Europe — and signal a new era in public transit. The arrival of the automated bus in Tampere, Finland, marks a significant milestone on the way to providing automated transport.</p><blockquote>Ali İhsan Danışman, Chief Commercial Officer of ADASTEC, shares his optimism: &quot;The deployment of our automated bus in Finland marks a groundbreaking moment for public transportation. This project is the culmination of our advanced Level-4 automation technology, ensuring that the bus operates safely and efficiently, even in the challenging Finnish winter conditions. Our partnership with Karsan and Applied Autonomy and our joint commitment to innovation and quality are instrumental in bringing this futuristic vision to life.&quot;</blockquote><p>‍</p><p>Preparations for the operation are underway; this venture is part of the SHOW project, the EU&#x27;s most significant initiative to develop sustainable transport solutions across Europe. The Karsan Autonomous e-ATAK incorporates ADASTEC’s sensor suite technology as a factory-fitted solution that allows it to achieve Level-4autonomy and drive in cities to navigate the complexities of urban traffic with precision and reliability. With a detailed route spanning 5.8km, including 17 bus stops and crossing 20 pedestrian paths, this bus is designed to offer a new level of precision and reliability in public transportation. The project showcases ADASTEC&#x27;s proven expertise in navigating adverse weather conditions, building on their successful deployments in Norway and Michigan, USA. The challenging Finnish winter provides a new backdrop for demonstrating the robust capabilities of ADASTEC&#x27;s sensor suite technology. This deployment underscores ADASTEC&#x27;s expertise in adverse weather operations, following successful projects in Norway and Michigan, USA. The Finnish winter season presents a new challenge, which ADASTEC is well-prepared to meet, thanks to its robust sensor suite technology and extensive experience in similar conditions.</p><blockquote>Karsan CEO Okan Baş said, &quot;Karsan continues to achieve firsts in the Scandinavian countries. In this context, we are breaking new ground and launching the first autonomous vehicle project in Finland. Karsan Autonomous e-ATAK, which we developed in cooperation with ADASTEC, will now serve in Tampere. We continue to transform the world&#x27;s transport infrastructure, especially in Europe, through our electric and autonomous vehicles. </blockquote><p>Applied Autonomy enhances the operation with its xFlow fleet management platform, ensuring public transport&#x27;s highest safety, efficiency, and optimization standards. This synergy between ADASTEC, Karsan, and Applied Autonomy underscores a comprehensive approach to automated bus operations, highlighting the combined efforts to revolutionize public transit in Tampere.</p><p>The project represents the state of the art in automated transport, as Olav Madland, CEO of Applied Autonomy, explains:</p><blockquote>&quot;We&#x27;re very excited to showcase in Tampere that providing a functioning and complete solution for real-life automated bus operations is finally possible. Our partnership with ADASTEC and Karsan has allowed us to keep pushing the boundaries of what&#x27;s possible so that we can now enable this automated transport offer. With xFlow at the helm of the operations, we&#x27;re looking forward to providing a solution that meets real needs.&quot;</blockquote><p>‍<br/>This leading-edge project marks a big step forward in making public transport smarter and greener. By bringing together the expertise of ADASTEC, Karsan, Applied Autonomy, and REMOTED, this initiative shows a strong commitment to improving city travel with advanced, sustainable technologies. As the automated bus starts its operations in Tampere, it not only introduces a new way to travel but also sets a new standard for future transportation.</p></div></div><script src="https://d3e54v103j8qbb.cloudfront.net/js/jquery-3.5.1.min.dc5e7f18c8.js?site=600ad06ae00a6210fd3a2752" type="text/javascript" integrity="sha256-9/aliU8dGd2tb6OSsuzixeV4y/faTqgFtohetphbbj0=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600ad06ae00a6210fd3a2752/js/webflow.8c2250f2.381e556a8c746557.js" type="text/javascript"></script></body></html>
