This pioneering initiative marks the first-ever global application of Level-4 automated bus technology for airport transportation in mixed traffic, showcasing ADASTEC&#x27;s leadership in advancing public transportation.<br/></p><p>By the end of 2024, once approved by the Dutch road authority RDW, ADASTEC and Karsan will have enhanced the route from Meijersplein metro station to Rotterdam The Hague Airport (RTHA) with two new automated busses. These services will provide passengers with a seamless, efficient, and eco-friendly travel option featuring ADASTEC&#x27;s SAE Level-4 automated driving software platform, <a href="/flowride-ai" target="_blank">flowride.ai</a>. Firstly, These will serve as a complement to the existing bus line 33. Each bus will be able to carry at least 15 passengers, including luggage, and will be wheelchair accessible. This development, supported by key transport operator RET and the collaborative efforts of RTHA, the Municipality of Rotterdam, DAM Shuttles, and the Metropolitan Region Rotterdam-The Hague (MRDH), establishes a new benchmark in Europe for automated public transportation to an airport. Together with the clients, ADASTEC and Karsan will now start the process to gain approval from the road authority.<br/></p><blockquote><strong>Dr. Ali Peker, Chief Executive Officer of ADASTEC</strong>, stated, &quot;Today, we are not just introducing a new service; we are setting a global precedent. This project at RTHA is a testament to our commitment to innovation and our vision for a future where automated buses enhance urban mobility. In partnership with Karsan and Applied Autonomy, ADASTEC has launched a pioneering service that, for the first time on a global scale, brings advanced automated bus technology to an airport setting, leading the way for future airport transport solutions. We extend our gratitude to all our partners, including RET, the Municipality of Rotterdam, RTHA, DAM Shuttles, and the Metropolitan Region Rotterdam-The Hague (MRDH), whose collaboration has been crucial in achieving this milestone. &quot;<br/></blockquote><p>Stating that they play a leading role in transforming public transport in the world with the vision of being &quot;One Step Ahead in the Future of Mobility&quot;, Karsan CEO Okan Baş said, &quot;Karsan Autonomous e-ATAK is a model that has proven its success with awards and its services in the regions where it carries passengers. Owing to this project, we will be the first brand in the world to carry out airport transfers with an autonomous vehicle. In the Netherlands, we maintain our attack on autonomous electric public transport, which we have initiated with Norway. We, as Karsan, will continue to pioneer the transformation in more countries.&quot;<br/></p><blockquote><strong>As Remco Derksen – Co-Founder and Director of DAM Shuttles </strong>- already explained on Dutch radio on March 1, 2024: “This is a very important next step in automated driving in pubic transport in Western Europe. We’re very content that Karsan and ADASTEC could meet our strict requirements and can provide a type approved bus. After almost 6 years of preparation, all parties are committed and eager to move forward.”<br/></blockquote><blockquote><strong>Ali İhsan Danışman, Chief Commercial Officer of ADASTEC</strong>, highlighted the project&#x27;s significance, &quot;This achievement goes beyond just a technological advance; it&#x27;s a step towards a more sustainable and accessible future. Our collaboration with Karsan and Applied Autonomy, under the leadership of RET and DAM Shuttles, the municipality of Rotterdam, RTHA, and the Metropolitan Region Rotterdam-The Hague (MRDH), has been crucial in making this vision a reality. Together, we&#x27;re not only improving the passenger experience but also contributing to global efforts to reduce carbon emissions.”<br/></blockquote><h3>As this service begins its operations, it marks a milestone not only for ADASTEC and its partners but also for the global transportation industry, setting new standards for innovation, efficiency, and sustainability.<br/><br/><strong>About ADASTEC Corp.</strong>‍</h3><p>Established in 2018, ADASTEC Corp is a leading US-based provider of Level-4 automation solutions for full-size buses and commercial vehicles.
