This groundbreaking deployment marks a significant milestone in the journey towards a smarter, more connected world of public transit.</p><p>The automated bus, equipped with ADASTEC’s sensor suite and automated driving software platform, flowride.ai, has commenced operations following an opening ceremony in Tampere. The event was attended by high-level representatives from Finnish transport company Remoted, Lempäälä, Finland&#x27;s public transport operator Nysse, and the Finnish press. The bus operates on a 5.5-kilometer segment of a 10.5-kilometer route between Haurala and Lempäälä in Tampere. This route includes 17 stops in the current operational area, with plans to add two more stops as the route expands to the full 10.5 kilometers, allowing the bus to serve more ticketed passengers and further integrating automated technology into everyday public transport services. The bus navigates complex urban environments, including traffic lights, roundabouts, and crosswalks, demonstrating the robust capabilities of ADASTEC&#x27;s flowride.ai , ensuring a reliable and efficient service for the people of Tampere.</p><blockquote>ADASTEC CEO Dr. Ali Peker remarked, &quot;As Finland&#x27;s first SAE Level-4 automated public transport vehicle, the Karsan Autonomous e-ATAK has begun serving the people of Tampere. At ADASTEC, we are proud to demonstrate once again the superior performance and reliability of our automated driving software with this project. Operating on a 5.5-kilometer route between Hauralantie and Lempäälä, the bus serves 17 stops and transports ticketed passengers in open traffic, providing a seamless solution even in challenging winter conditions.In the future, our route will expand to 10.5 kilometers, continuing to serve even more passengers. With our advanced technology and the experience we&#x27;ve gained in adverse weather conditions, we ensure safe and comfortable journeys in all weather. This launch reaffirms our commitment to sustainable and innovative public transport solutions. With our vision of shaping the future of urban mobility, we will continue to revolutionize public transportation systems.&quot;</blockquote><blockquote>Karsan CEO Okan Baş added, &quot;Autonomous e-ATAK is Finland&#x27;s full-size autonomous bus that carries ticketed passengers and is being used on public transportation routes on roads open to traffic, following the US and Norway. Karsan Autonomous e-ATAK, which will serve in the city of Tampere, which is located between two lakes, will follow a 5.5-kilometer round-trip route. The 17-stop route will include traffic lights, intersections, pedestrian crossings and other challenging elements for automated vehicles, but Autonomous e-ATAK can easily overcome them as a model that has proven its success worldwide. Our maximum speed will be 30 km/h on the first part of this route, but when the second route is added, our vehicle will reach 40 kilometers per hour.&quot; </blockquote><blockquote>Dr.Ali Peker further noted, &quot;We have confidence that our software will operate efficiently in Finland’s adverse weather conditions, drawing from our extensive experience in Stavanger and Michigan State University operations. We are poised to tackle this new challenge with our robust automated driving technology. In the initial part of this route, the maximum speed will be 30km/h, but once the second route is added, the vehicle will reach up to 40km/h.&quot;</blockquote><h2>Driving Inclusive and Sustainable Impact</h2><p>ADASTEC&#x27;s vision extends beyond automation. Committed to creating a smarter, more connected future that enhances public transit for everyone, ADASTEC&#x27;s technology aims to provide reliable and efficient transportation options for underserved communities, significantly reducing the carbon footprint of public transportation systems while delivering numerous societal benefits. </p><blockquote>As Dr. Ali Peker mentioned, &quot;With our vision of shaping the future of urban mobility, we are dedicated to driving inclusive and sustainable impacts through our innovative solutions.&quot;</blockquote><p>This successful launch in Tampere highlights ADASTEC&#x27;s strong commitment to advancing public transportation through advanced automation technology. By continuously pushing the boundaries of what is possible, ADASTEC aims to set new standards in the industry, ensuring safer, more efficient, and environmentally friendly public transport solutions. As we look towards the future, ADASTEC remains dedicated to enhancing the urban mobility landscape, driving forward with a vision of inclusivity and sustainability, and making a lasting impact on communities worldwide.</p><p>‍</p></div></div><script src="https://d3e54v103j8qbb.cloudfront.net/js/jquery-3.5.1.min.dc5e7f18c8.js?site=600ad06ae00a6210fd3a2752" type="text/javascript" integrity="sha256-9/aliU8dGd2tb6OSsuzixeV4y/faTqgFtohetphbbj0=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/600ad06ae00a6210fd3a2752/js/webflow.8c2250f2.381e556a8c746557.js" type="text/javascript"></script></body></html>
