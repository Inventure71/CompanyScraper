        <p><br>Investments in ambitious infrastructure and energy transition projects are projected to drive non-residential spending to $1.033 trillion in the United States in 20232.

These programs include building and modernizing electric grids, water projects, freight and passenger rail transportation, airports, electric vehicle charging and alternative fuel infrastructure, <a href="/news/recharge-industries-engages-accenture-to-help-design-and-engineer-one-of-the-worlds-largest-gigafactories-in-australia.htm">gigafactories</a>, semiconductor plants, broadband internet and public buildings.<br><br>Anser Advisory has a proven track record of reducing the risks and impacts of project delays and cost overruns on large-scale critical infrastructure projects.
