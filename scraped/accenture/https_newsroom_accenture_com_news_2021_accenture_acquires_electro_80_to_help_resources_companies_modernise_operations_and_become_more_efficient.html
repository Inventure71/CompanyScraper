        <p><br>“Resources and asset-intensive companies are increasingly looking for ways to deliver more with less and, at the same time, in a more sustainable way,” said Tara Brady, market unit lead for Accenture in Australia and New Zealand. “Digital and automation technologies will be fundamental in delivering these outcomes and we are delighted to have Electro 80 on board.”<br><br>Sergej Divkovi, Electro 80’s managing director said, “Combining our team’s deep digital and OT expertise with Accenture’s end-to-end capabilities presents immense opportunities for our employees and clients.
