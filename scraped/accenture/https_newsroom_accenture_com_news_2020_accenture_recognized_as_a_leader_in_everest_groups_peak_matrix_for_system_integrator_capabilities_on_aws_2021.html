        <p>According to Everest Group, Accenture is clearly differentiated, positioned highest among all service providers working with AWS, especially in overall Market Impact for adoption, portfolio mix and value delivered. Accenture is also at the top for Vision &#x26; Capability, notably scoring highest in vision, strategy, innovation and investments. In the analysis, Accenture is seen as driving large-scale and complex cloud transformation for large enterprises.<br><br>“Accenture continues to win large deals by placing heavy emphasis on innovative architecture and joint transformation initiative with AWS through its Accenture AWS Business Group while taking commercial risks associated with business outcomes,” said Ashwin Venkatesan, vice president, Cloud and Infrastructure Services, at Everest Group. “We also learned that clients have identified strategy development, program management, migration planning, and strong collaboration with AWS as the biggest strengths for Accenture in the market.”</p>
