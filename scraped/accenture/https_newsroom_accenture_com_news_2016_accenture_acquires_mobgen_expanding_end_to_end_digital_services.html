        <p><br>“The MOBGEN acquisition strengthens and expands the capabilities of Accenture Digital in Europe,” said Marc Huijbregts, Accenture Digital lead in the Netherlands. “Demand for mobility platforms, services and applications is mounting, but as the IoT grows, these need to be built for an increasingly complex range of functions and devices while keeping the user experience in mind.”<br><br>Jack Ramsay, senior managing director, Accenture Digital, continued: “To deliver the greatest value, mobility solutions must support overall business strategies, and be wholly integrated with back-end systems to ensure data-driven personalised services can be delivered to users. With their holistic approach and focus on service design, meshing their creative and technology experience to strengthen brand relationships, MOBGEN will help Accenture offer clients across Europe the support they need to match the fast pace of technological change.”<br><br>“Being chosen for acquisition by a company with the stature of Accenture is fantastic news for our employees and our clients,” said Ron Vrijmoet, CEO and founder of MOBGEN. “We are still only in the discovery phase of how this mobile revolution will transform the way we live and work, and our clients know that to provide the very best, most exciting customer experiences, the underpinning digital solutions are critical. MOBGEN is and will remain at the centre of this revolution as part of Accenture Digital, offering our existing and new clients access to deep industry expertise and global, scalable service design and technology resources that will help them build ever-stronger relationships with their customers and employees.”<br><br>MOBGEN serves clients across a wide range of industries including finance, retail and travel, and has won industry recognition from the Webby Awards, the Red Dot Best of the Best Award, the Dutch Interactive Awards, and the European Business Awards, among others.<br><br>Aegon, one of MOBGEN’s first corporate clients, made a significant contribution to the success of MOBGEN and became an important investor in the company. As part of this acquisition, Aegon - who will stay focused on supporting startups - has sold its shares to Accenture, and MOBGEN will now operate as part of Accenture Digital.<br><br><strong>About Accenture</strong><br>Accenture is a leading global professional services company, providing a broad range of services and solutions in strategy, consulting, digital, technology and operations.

Words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “likely,” “anticipates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “projects,” “believes,” “estimates,” “positioned,” “outlook” and similar expressions are used to identify these forward-looking statements. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. These include, without limitation, risks that: the transaction might not achieve the anticipated benefits for the company; the company’s results of operations could be adversely affected by volatile, negative or uncertain economic conditions and the effects of these conditions on the company’s clients’ businesses and levels of business activity; the company’s business depends on generating and maintaining ongoing, profitable client demand for the company’s services and solutions, and a significant reduction in such demand could materially affect the company’s results of operations; if the company is unable to keep its supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand around the world and attract and retain professionals with strong leadership skills, the company’s business, the utilization rate of the company’s professionals and the company’s results of operations may be materially adversely affected; the markets in which the company competes are highly competitive, and the company might not be able to compete effectively; the company could have liability or the company’s reputation could be damaged if the company fails to protect client and/or company data or information systems as obligated by law or contract or if the company’s information systems are breached; the company’s results of operations and ability to grow could be materially negatively affected if the company cannot adapt and expand its services and solutions in response to ongoing changes in technology and offerings by new entrants; the company’s results of operations could materially suffer if the company is not able to obtain sufficient pricing to enable it to meet its profitability expectations; if the company does not accurately anticipate the cost, risk and complexity of performing its work or if the third parties upon whom it relies do not meet their commitments, then the company’s contracts could have delivery inefficiencies and be less profitable than expected or unprofitable; the company’s results of operations could be materially adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; the company’s profitability could suffer if its cost-management strategies are unsuccessful, and the company may not be able to improve its profitability through improvements to cost-management to the degree it has done in the past; the company’s business could be materially adversely affected if the company incurs legal liability; the company’s work with government clients exposes the company to additional risks inherent in the government contracting environment; the company might not be successful at identifying, acquiring or integrating businesses, entering into joint ventures or divesting businesses; the company’s Global Delivery Network is increasingly concentrated in India and the Philippines, which may expose it to operational risks; changes in the company’s level of taxes, as well as audits, investigations and tax proceedings, or changes in the company’s treatment as an Irish company, could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations and financial condition; as a result of the company’s geographically diverse operations and its growth strategy to continue geographic expansion, the company is more susceptible to certain risks; adverse changes to the company’s relationships with key alliance partners or in the business of its key alliance partners could adversely affect the company’s results of operations; the company’s services or solutions could infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others or the company might lose its ability to utilize the intellectual property of others; if the company is unable to protect its intellectual property rights from unauthorized use or infringement by third parties, its business could be adversely affected; the company’s ability to attract and retain business and employees may depend on its reputation in the marketplace; if the company is unable to manage the organizational challenges associated with its size, the company might be unable to achieve its business objectives; any changes to the estimates and assumptions that the company makes in connection with the preparation of its consolidated financial statements could adversely affect its financial results; many of the company’s contracts include payments that link some of its fees to the attainment of performance or business targets and/or require the company to meet specific service levels, which could increase the variability of the company’s revenues and impact its margins; if the company is unable to collect its receivables or unbilled services, the company’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected; the company’s results of operations and share price could be adversely affected if it is unable to maintain effective internal controls; the company may be subject to criticism and negative publicity related to its incorporation in Ireland; as well as the risks, uncertainties and other factors discussed under the “Risk Factors” heading in Accenture plc’s most recent annual report on Form 10-K and other documents filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Statements in this news release speak only as of the date they were made, and Accenture undertakes no duty to update any forward-looking statements made in this news release or to conform such statements to actual results or changes in Accenture’s expectations.<br><br># # #<br><br><strong>Contact:</strong><br><br>Anja van Beijnum<br>Accenture<br>+ 31 6 133 00 503<br><a href="mailto:anja.van.beijnum@accenture.com">anja.van.beijnum@accenture.com</a><br><br>Anthony Hatter<br>Accenture<br>+ 44 7810 756 138<br><a href="mailto:anthony.hatter@accenture.com">anthony.hatter@accenture.com</a></p>
