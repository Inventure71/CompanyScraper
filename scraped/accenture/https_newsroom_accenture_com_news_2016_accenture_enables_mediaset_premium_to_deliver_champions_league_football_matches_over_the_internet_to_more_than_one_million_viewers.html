        <p>Mediaset Premium Play soccer service has drawn more than 600,000 unique monthly visitors to Mediaset Premium’s multi-device service – doubling the number of visitors since the service was made available last July.<br><br>Mediaset Premium’s Play service combines the intelligence and power of the Accenture Video Solution (AVS) platform, already used by more than 60 million people on thousands of device models, with the scalability and rich feature set of the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud.<br><br>Leveraging capabilities made available through the recently formed <a href="/news/accenture-and-amazon-web-services-create-new-business-group-to-help-enterprises-migrate-to-and-run-their-business-in-the-aws-cloud.htm">Accenture AWS Business Group</a>, the Accenture Video Solution dynamically provides the infrastructure capacity needed to stream matches based on the users requesting the service. This feature enables Mediaset Premium to avoid the expense of acquiring additional hardware as the number of subscribers increases, using only the resources needed at any point in time.<br><br>The Accenture Video Solution provides a large catalogue of pre-built features needed to quickly develop and deliver the service. The cloud-based platform features analytics that generate real-time insights about viewer behaviors that help Mediaset Premium attract more viewers by providing more personalized services.<br><br>“Mediaset Premium reaching one million subscribers with this new service in only three months, leveraging the cloud, is a major achievement in the video broadcast industry,” said Franco Ricci, Mediaset Premium’s chief executive officer. “This is directly attributable to the intelligent, seamless, and streamlined way that Accenture used its Accenture Video Solution with its Digital Delivery Factory – a set of tools and methodologies that integrate products, architecture, and technologies into one operation – for continuous digital content delivery. Accenture provided the right mix of proximity, agility, and cost to support our business goals. These latest successes build on the long-standing and successful collaborations between Mediaset and Accenture.”<br><br>Mediaset Premium Play is available for consumers in Italy on more than 300 different device models such as smartphones, tablet PCs, set-top boxes, connected TVs, and game consoles.<br><br>“Combining the Accenture Video Solution with the flexible AWS cloud platform, Mediaset Premium can deliver competitive, high-quality programming over the top to a large number of viewers as a service,” said Francesco Venturini, global managing director for Accenture’s Media and Entertainment and Digital Video businesses. “The subscriber growth and shortened time-to-market are impressive benchmarks for the European broadcast market, and continue the successes Accenture and Mediaset have been achieving for the past several years.”<br><br>According to Accenture research and analysis, the video platform market is growing at 19 percent per year. The market was estimated to be $3.2 billion in 2015 and will grow to $5.4 billion in 2018. Over the next five years, the broadcast market is projected to grow at 6.3 percent per year and amount to $579 billion by that same year.<br><br>The Accenture Video Solution delivers video content to IPTV and over-the-top TV set-top boxes, PCs, smartphones, tablets, connected TVs and gaming consoles.
