        <p>NEW YORK; Nov. 9, 2023 – Accenture (NYSE: ACN) will launch a network of generative AI studios in North America where companies can explore ways to optimize and reinvent their business through the responsible use of generative AI applications.</p>

        <p>Clients interested in pursuing commercial uses of generative AI will be able to visit the studios at Accenture Innovation Hubs in Chicago, Houston, New York, San Francisco, Toronto and Washington, D.C. These generative AI studios will have areas of specialization, enabling clients to explore industry use cases, co-innovate, conduct AI pilots, and rapidly initiate and scale programs.</p>
        <p>“The studios are designed to help our clients move from interest to action to value, in a responsible way with clear business cases,” said Manish Sharma, North America CEO of Accenture. “We are constantly refreshing our learnings from more than <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/lan-guan_generativeai-activity-7128037979951886336-9-Ea?utm_source=share&#x26;utm_medium=member_desktop">3,000 client conversations</a> on generative AI this year. We use these conversations as demand signals to understand the real-world challenges our clients face and invest in the areas of greatest need and opportunity.”</p>
        <p>As part of <a href="https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/accenture-to-invest-3-billion-in-ai-to-accelerate-clients-reinvention.htm">Accenture’s $3 billion investment in data and AI</a>, the studios will connect clients with Accenture’s top data and AI experts, who will help them leverage Accenture’s ecosystem partnerships, ventures, and strategic investments within the Center for Advanced AI, as well as more than 1,450 patents and patent applications in our AI solutions, and learnings from more than 300 active generative AI projects.</p>
        <p>“Clients are ready to move beyond generative AI experimentation. They want to harness generative AI at scale to fundamentally reinvent their business,” added Sharma. “Clients will come to the studios to access the latest innovations, experiment with new technologies, tools, and approaches to advance their skills, and develop roadmaps to adopt generative AI at scale.”</p>
        <p>Each of the generative AI studios supports all of Accenture’s industries and functions; however, some locations will have deeper specialization, reflecting the specific needs of clients in that location.</p>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Chicago</strong> will specialize in financial services, health, life sciences, consumer goods and services, Industry X and manufacturing.</li>
          <li>Houston will specialize in Industry X, chemicals, energy and utilities industries.</li>
          <li><strong>New York</strong> will specialize in life sciences and financial services.</li>
          <li><strong>San Francisco</strong> will specialize in software and platforms and communications, media, and technology.</li>
          <li><strong>Toronto</strong> will specialize in financial services, retail, health, and public service.</li>
          <li><strong>Washington, D.C.</strong> will specialize in health, public service, including federal government services.</li>
        </ul>
