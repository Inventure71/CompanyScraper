        <p>The Seattle-area company has become part of Accenture Security’s Cyber Defense offerings. Financial terms of the agreement were not disclosed.<br><br>Serving some of the world’s largest technology companies, Deja vu Security provides a full range of security services designed to strengthen business applications and increase cyber resilience by integrating security throughout the product development lifecycle. Founded in 2011, Deja vu Security brings to Accenture a deep expertise in the techniques, tools and methods for securing connected devices and IoT networks. The acquisition of Deja vu Security also builds on Accenture Security’s commitment to investing in and innovating next-generation cybersecurity solutions to help protect clients’ business from end to end.</p>
        <p>Accenture has acquired Deja vu Security, ‘Security of Things’ company that specializes in security services to strengthen business applications from end to end by integrating #security throughout the product development lifecycle.</p>
        <p><br><br>“For technology companies, third-party suppliers and consumers alike, IoT security controls often remain an afterthought — which is why it’s critical that security is built in from the start for any new products, processes or services,” said Kelly Bissell, senior managing director of Accenture Security. “Deja vu Security’s team of innovative specialists brings considerable technical cybersecurity skills, making them a strong strategic fit, and will help our clients reduce the risk of their connected solutions. We are very excited to welcome the Deja vu Security team to Accenture.”<br><br>High-profile cyberattacks continue to demonstrate how vulnerable enterprise networks can result in significant business disruption and financial loss. Recent Accenture <a href="/news/cybercrime-could-cost-companies-us-5-2-trillion-over-next-five-years-according-to-new-research-from-accenture.htm">research</a> found that companies globally could incur US$5.2 trillion in additional costs and lost revenue over the next five years due to cyberattacks, as dependence on complex internet-enabled business models outpaces the ability to introduce adequate safeguards that protect critical assets.<br><br>Adam Cecchetti, Deja vu Security’s chief executive officer, said, “Today’s announcement is an exciting new chapter for Deja vu Security and our employees. Accenture’s people-focused culture and innovative mindset are core values that both companies share, and our unique capabilities complement each other perfectly. We are thrilled to be joining such a high-caliber global organization.”<br><br><strong>About Accenture</strong><br>Accenture is a leading global professional services company, providing a broad range of services and solutions in strategy, consulting, digital, technology and operations.
