        <p>PARIS; June 1, 2021 – Accenture (NYSE: ACN) has entered into an agreement to acquire Nell’Armonia, a leading consulting and technology company specialized in enterprise performance management (EPM) solutions, headquartered in Paris, France. Financial terms of the transaction are not being disclosed.</p>

      <div>
        <p>Founded in 2005, Nell’Armonia has more than 135 highly skilled professionals with experience in Oracle EPM cloud solutions, as well as Anaplan, CCH Tagetik and OneStream solutions, serving clients across France and Israel with services that cover the entire EPM spectrum, from advisory to implementation and maintenance. Nell’Armonia complements Accenture’s existing capabilities and would enhance its ability to address clients’ needs for analytics-based insights to support finance and end-to-end enterprise planning. As a result, CFOs would be able to move with greater speed and take on more responsibility for strategy, execution, and the sustainable future of the enterprise.</p>

        <p>“Robust EPM capabilities that bring together data, technology and talent are critical for creating a more dynamic, agile and actionable performance management process,” said Olivier Girard, market unit lead, Accenture France and Benelux. “Accenture is committed to providing the best resources and capabilities to meet the needs of our clients, and the combination of Accenture and Nell’Armonia would allow us to deliver the latest, most comprehensive solutions to help organizations succeed in their EPM transformations.”<br><br>Stephanie Jandard, managing director and Technology lead, Accenture France, said, “Many large French companies will engage in EPM transformation powered by cloud innovation and motivated by their commitment to sustainability. This is driven by leaders’ increasing need for a holistic, real-time view of their company’s critical functions, such as finance, HR and supply chain management, reliable insight on their Environmental, Social and Governance performance and the potential value that integrating sustainability into their business decision making can bring.”<br><br>Eric Leroy, CEO and founder of Nell’Armonia, added, “Many clients have undertaken projects to transform their EPM model. Reporting, planning, budgeting and forecasting processes are critical components for the success of such major technological and business transformations. Combining our strengths with Accenture would allow us to extend EPM beyond the finance function and strengthen our innovation capabilities by using the latest technologies such as artificial intelligence, predictive analytics and robotics. The opportunity to join Accenture would open up tremendous opportunities for our company and our people. Together, we would be able to support a larger number of companies in successful management transformation projects, integrating all the key functions of the company."<br><br>The acquisition requires prior consultation with the relevant works councils and would be subject to customary closing conditions.<br><br><strong>About Accenture</strong><br>Accenture is a global professional services company with leading capabilities in digital, cloud and security.
