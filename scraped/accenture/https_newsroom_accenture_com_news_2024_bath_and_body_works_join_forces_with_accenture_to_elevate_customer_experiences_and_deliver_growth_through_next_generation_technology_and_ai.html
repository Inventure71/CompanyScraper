        <p>As part of its vision to drive growth, Bath &#x26; Body Works will also work with Accenture to create new and innovative capabilities like a digital Fragrance Finder, a gen AI-powered conversational experience to help customers find the perfect fragrance tailored to their individual preferences. This comes as <a href="https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insights/consulting/empowered-consumer?c=acn_glb_cross-productscmediarelations_14101077&#x26;n=mrl_0424">Accenture’s Consumer Pulse 2024 research</a> found that more than half (51%) of consumers are already open to using conversational AI solutions.</p>
        <p>“We are focused on leveraging our core strengths in fragrance and augmenting these with cutting-edge technology and AI experiences such as native mobile, headless commerce, MarTech and transformer-based neural networks to deliver hyper-relevant and immersive experiences to customers with greater precision,” said Thilina Gunasinghe, Chief Digital and Technology Officer, Bath &#x26; Body Works.</p>
        <p>“Our collaboration with Bath &#x26; Body Works on its continuous reinvention will help this beloved brand continue to raise the bar on the retail customer experience,” said Julie Sweet, chair and CEO, Accenture. “Together, we will build a strong digital core of cloud, data and AI and innovative gen AI solutions that can help Bath &#x26; Body Works create value, foster growth and continually delight their customers in new ways.”</p>
