        <p><br>The move follows Accenture’s recent acquisition of <a href="/news/accenture-completes-acquisition-of-anser-advisory.htm">Anser Advisory</a>, a leading advisory and management company for infrastructure projects in the United States, which has bolstered Accenture’s capital projects capabilities in North America.<br><br>With Comtech Group, Accenture is now expanding its capital projects capabilities in Canada. These capabilities include project structuring, estimating and planning; digitization; monitoring the work being done; and assisting clients in managing and executing all phases of projects. Accenture also helps clients develop smarter, more efficient infrastructure for energy transition, transportation and production from the outset. Like Anser Advisory, Comtech Group joins Accenture’s digital engineering and manufacturing service, <a href="https://www.accenture.com/us-en/services/digital-engineering-manufacturing-index">Industry X</a>.<br><br>Aaron Saint, North America lead for Industry X at Accenture, said: “With Comtech Group, we will help our clients deliver mission-critical infrastructure projects on time and on budget. This requires industry expertise, ‘boots on the ground’ know-how, and increasingly, artificial intelligence (AI) and other digital capabilities to better plan, measure and monitor how these projects are executed. By combining Accenture and Comtech Group capabilities, we can better help deliver on our clients’ ambitious infrastructure programs.”<br><br>David Morgenstern, president of Accenture in Canada, commented: “We are expanding our capabilities at a time that Canada is committing to major infrastructure projects. Our country has deep roots in manufacturing, process and engineering industries. We are also home to leading organizations in AI, automation and robotics. Comtech Group will enhance our ability to bring value and productivity to clients in this evolving landscape.”<br><br>Hugo Blasutta, president and CEO of Comtech Group, said: “Comtech Group has an established track record supporting some of Canada’s most complex, large-scale infrastructure programs. As part of Accenture, we can deliver our proven solutions to even more clients in more industries. We are excited about Accenture’s commitment to innovation as shown in its recent <a href="/news/accenture-to-invest-3-billion-in-ai-to-accelerate-clients-reinvention.htm">$3 billion investment in AI</a>. Joining this world-leading organization will also offer exciting new opportunities to our people.”<br><br>Other acquisitions Accenture has made to support its clients’ infrastructure projects include <a href="/news/accenture-completes-acquisition-of-eclipse-automation.htm">Eclipse Automation</a>, a provider of customized manufacturing automation and robotics solutions headquartered in Cambridge, Canada; <a href="/news/accenture-acquires-advoco-scaling-capabilities-for-intelligent-asset-management-solutions.htm">Advoco,</a> a US-based asset management services provider; <a href="/news/accenture-acquires-ati-solutions-group-to-help-clients-in-australia-automate-field-operations-faster-and-more-efficiently.htm">ATI Solutions Group</a>, an Australian consulting service provider to the mining, energy and rail industries; and <a href="/news/accenture-completes-acquisition-of-umlaut.htm">umlaut</a>, a global engineering services provider, headquartered in Germany.<br><br><strong>Forward-Looking Statements</strong><br>Except for the historical information and discussions contained herein, statements in this news release may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
