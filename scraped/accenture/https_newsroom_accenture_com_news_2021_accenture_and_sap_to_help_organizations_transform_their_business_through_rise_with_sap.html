        <p><br><br>Accenture brings technology and industry services that simplify the move to cloud and boost innovation</p>
        <p><br>NEW YORK, Jan. 27, 2021 – Accenture (NYSE: ACN) is working with SAP to help organizations accelerate business transformation through cloud-based deployments of SAP® solutions. With a goal of supporting clients at any stage of their transformation journey, Accenture is offering solutions and services that help lower the cost and risk of migrating SAP S/4HANA® to the cloud and pave the way for a reinvention of business models and processes.</p>

        <p>New <a href="http://www.accenture.com/us-en/Insights/technology/maximize-cloud-value">research</a> from Accenture found that the vast majority of companies recognize that cloud provides the means to a variety of business benefits – greater cost efficiencies, improved service levels, and greater speed to market as well as enabling reimagined business models and improving business resilience. However, just 37% of companies say they are achieving the full value expected on cloud investments. Accenture and SAP are working together to help clients embark on business transformation through RISE with SAP, a new business transformation offering that uses the flexibility of public or private cloud infrastructure to provide the full intelligent enterprise experience, including the enterprise resource planning capabilities of SAP S/4HANA and integration with SAP Business Technology Platform.</p>
