        <p><br>“According to Accenture’s research, Brazil continues to be a hotspot for cybercrime, which we estimate could cost companies more than US$100 billion in lost revenues by 2023,” said Kelly Bissell, who leads Accenture Security globally. “The acquisition of Real Protect is a natural complement to our existing Managed Security Services business, which offers tailored industry-focused solutions to help clients rapidly anticipate, detect and respond in real time to cyber threats. We welcome Real Protect to Accenture and are excited about what we can achieve together to help organizations be more resilient.”<br><br>Real Protect’s approximately 90 cybersecurity professionals, who serve a variety of clients in the healthcare, energy, oil &#x26; gas, and financial services industries, will join Accenture Security’s global workforce of nearly 7,000 professionals. Real Protect CEO Daniel Lemos will lead Accenture’s Managed Security Services business in Latin America.<br><br>“We are excited to join Accenture​ and tap into their breadth of MSS capabilities, building on the success we have achieved in our business to date,” said Lemos. “Together, our shared commitment to providing market-leading cybersecurity solutions positions us well to drive growth in the adoption of these services in Brazil and across Latin America.”</p>
