        <p><br>The firm specializes in providing strategic consultancy services to health sector clients spanning capability areas such as health systems integration, informatics and analytics, and solution implementation and program management. Gevity also leads clients through digital transformations and information systems design implementations. In addition, Gevity offers proprietary methods and tools to support its work, including project and program management, inter-organizational collaboration, and health informatics. A key differentiator for Gevity is its strategic use of interdisciplinary teams comprised of practitioners with experience in clinical, technical and administrative roles in healthcare settings.<br><br>“The addition of Gevity will expand our capabilities in delivering health transformation services in Canada and other global markets,” said Jeffrey Russell, president of Accenture in Canada. “Gevity’s talented team and track record of success combined with Accenture’s national leadership in transformation services and strong ecosystem partnerships will strengthen our capabilities from coast to coast. Moreover, the acquisition positions Accenture to lead the wave of tech-enabled health innovation that places people’s health at the center to improve access, experience, and outcomes.”<br><br>Jane Kerr, managing director and Canadian client group lead for resources, provincial and public health at Accenture, said, “The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the need for health organizations to modernize their technology systems and restructure their operating models to reduce costs and be more efficient. Gevity’s experienced team of professionals will significantly enhance our ability to harness the power of technology and human ingenuity to lead change for Canadian public and private health organizations as they look to complete large-scale transformations.”<br><br>In addition to the Victoria headquarters, Gevity has people located across Canada in Alberta, Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, as well as in the United States and the Philippines, who will join Accenture.<br><br>“Over the last 25 years, Gevity has been focused on delivering on its mission to enable a healthier world by helping clients modernize for the future,” added Marc Koehn, CEO of Gevity. “By joining Accenture’s global Health practice, with its leading capabilities in digital, design, cloud, security and customer experience, we can together have a greater impact on the transformation of Canada’s healthcare industry and open up exciting career opportunities for our team members.”<br><br>Gevity is the second acquisition for Accenture Canada in 2021 to bolster its strength and capabilities in the Canadian market.
