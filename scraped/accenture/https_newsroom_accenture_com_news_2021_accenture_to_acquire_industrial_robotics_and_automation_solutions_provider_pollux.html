        <p><br>Founded in 1996, Pollux has implemented more than 1,000 projects for manufacturing companies, primarily in Brazil. Many of the world’s largest pharmaceutical and food companies use technology solutions from Pollux in their Brazil operations, and a high number of vehicles made in the country involve Pollux’s manufacturing solutions.<br><br>This is Accenture’s first acquisition of an industrial robotics solutions provider and will encompass Pollux’s operations in Brazil, Ecuador, Mexico, Canada and the United States. Pollux’s more than 290 professionals will join <a href="http://www.accenture.com/industryx">Accenture’s Industry X group</a>, which embeds intelligence in how clients run factories and plants, as well as design and engineer connected products and services.<br><br>Nigel Stacey, global lead for Accenture Industry X, said: “Automation and human + machine collaboration are digitally transforming manufacturing and supply chain operations to be more flexible, resilient, sustainable and safe, and to better meet ever-changing customer demands. Tangibly seeing these benefits in practice requires a true integration of information technology and operations technology, which is what Pollux will allow us to offer our manufacturing clients.”<br><br>Renato Improta, Latin America lead for Accenture Industry X, added: “Pollux’s expertise and experience in robotics and automation solutions will complement our industry consulting skills and industrial IT and applied intelligence capabilities. This combination will enable us to deliver real-time supply chain and operations orchestration with flexible manufacturing functions to our clients.”<br><br>José Rizzo Hahn Filho, CEO and founder of Pollux, commented: “As part of Accenture Industry X, we can offer existing and new clients complete transformation of manufacturing and logistics processes. Combining IT innovations with industrial automation can enable powerful new business models, in which, for example, a consumer’s purchase at home immediately triggers a robot’s next move in a factory on the other side of the planet.”<br><br>Pollux will be the latest acquisition Accenture has made to strengthen its digital manufacturing, operations and supply chain capabilities.
