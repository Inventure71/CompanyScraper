          <h1>Assessing the state of your leadership maturity today</h1>

          <p>Before embarking on a journey to become the ideal leader, it is essential to know your starting point. This is the key to determining the distance ahead, as well as the best path to take. With that in mind, we created a tool to assess where you currently fit within the three leadership archetypes and pinpoint what changes are needed to elevate your leadership characteristics.</p>

          <p>The assessment is intended as a rough guide to help you judge in which pillars you and your organization have mature leadership behaviors, mindsets, practices and values, and where there is room for improvement. It is fifteen questions that measure the Responsible Leadership Elements and the behaviors that underly effective leadership. It has been designed to be leveraged on an individual basis, or as a collective assessment of your organization’s leaders, and has been validated against leadership and culture literature, frameworks and theories.</p>
