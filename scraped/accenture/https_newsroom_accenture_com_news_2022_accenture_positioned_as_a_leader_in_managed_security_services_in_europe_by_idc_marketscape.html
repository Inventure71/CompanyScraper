        <p><em>IDC MarketScape vendor analysis model is designed to provide an overview of the competitive fitness of ICT suppliers in a given market. The research methodology utilizes a rigorous scoring methodology based on both qualitative and quantitative criteria that results in a single graphical illustration of each vendor’s position within a given market. The Capabilities score measures vendor product, go-to-market and business execution in the short-term. The Strategy score measures alignment of vendor strategies with customer requirements in a 3-5-year timeframe. Vendor market share is represented by the size of the icons.</em></p>
        <p>“Today’s cyber threats are too constant, complex and costly to be tackled alone,” said Paolo Dal Cin, a senior managing director who leads Accenture Security in Europe. “That’s why Accenture continually invests in bringing the best of our global capabilities, including industry-specific knowledge and an understanding of diverse regional regulatory requirements, to help clients better defend against the most persistent threats and strengthen their security posture.”<br><br>Following its January 2020 acquisition of <a href="/news/accenture-to-acquire-symantecs-cyber-security-services-business-from-broadcom.htm">Symantec’s Cyber Security Services business</a>, Accenture became one of the leading global providers of managed security services. Accenture further strengthened its cyber defense and MSS capabilities as well as expanded its strong presence across multiple European countries through the acquisitions of <a href="/news/accenture-acquires-context-information-security-a-uk-based-cybersecurity-consultancy.htm">Context Information Security</a> in March 2020, and <a href="/news/accenture-acquires-sentor-enhancing-its-cyber-defense-and-managed-security-services-in-sweden.htm">Sentor</a>, <a href="/news/accenture-completes-acquisition-of-linkbynet-for-cloud-first-services.htm">Linkbynet</a>, and <a href="/news/accenture-completes-acquisition-of-openminded.htm">Openminded</a> in 2021.<br><br>“The rapid adoption of cloud services along with remote work practices has added new layers of complexity for IT security practitioners to address,” said Joel Stradling, research director, IDC European Security and Privacy. “The combination of these trends, in addition to the growing sophistication of the cyberthreats companies face, is driving strong demand for MSS in Europe. Accenture offers considerable European and global scale as an end-to-end consulting provider with a strong portfolio that can help protect businesses from these evolving threats in cybersecurity.<br><br>In addition to being named a Leader in the IDC MarketScape, Accenture was recently positioned as a Leader in two Forrester reports on cybersecurity: <a href="/news/accenture-named-a-leader-among-global-cybersecurity-providers-in-independent-report.htm">The Forrester Wave™: Global Cybersecurity Consulting Providers, Q4 2021</a> and <a href="/news/accenture-named-a-leader-among-european-cybersecurity-consulting-providers-according-to-independent-research-firm.htm">The Forrester Wave™: European Cybersecurity Consulting Providers, Q3 2021</a>.<br><br>More information about Accenture’s Managed Security Services and its position in the IDC MarketScape report can be found <a href="https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insights/security/leader-european-managed-security-services">here</a>.<br><br><strong>About IDC MarketScape</strong><br>IDC MarketScape vendor assessment model is designed to provide an overview of the competitive fitness of ICT (information and communications technology) suppliers in a given market.
