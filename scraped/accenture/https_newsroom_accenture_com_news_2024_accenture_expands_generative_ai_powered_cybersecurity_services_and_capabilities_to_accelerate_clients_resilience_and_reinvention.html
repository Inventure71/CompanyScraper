        <p>NEW YORK; Nov. 19, 2024 – Accenture (NYSE:ACN) today announced new services and capabilities designed to reinvent business and cyber resilience through the power of gen AI, deepfake protection and quantum-safe data security solutions to help clients across industries become cyber-resilient organizations.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>Cybercriminals are increasingly using gen AI and dark large language models (LLMs) to launch new types of cyberattacks. In fact, <a href="https://www.accenture.com/cn-en/blogs/security/beyond-illusion-unmasking-real-threats-deepfakes">Accenture’s cyber intelligence (ACI) researchers</a> have observed a 223% surge in deepfake-related tool trading on dark web forums in the first quarter of 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. The ACI team expects a significant rise in AI-driven cyberattacks, a warning signal that organizations need to adopt advanced AI-based cybersecurity measures that detect, respond to, predict and prevent threats in real-time.</p>
        <p>“Modern cybersecurity protects across the entire business—from the digital core to the supply chain—and draws on gen AI-powered and quantum-proof protections, which are vital as cybercriminals ramp up new kinds of attacks using advanced AI technologies,” said Julie Sweet, chair and CEO, Accenture. “Our new cybersecurity services and centers help our clients use the latest technologies to safeguard their critical assets and increase their resilience, so they can reinvent with confidence and create more value faster.”</p>

        <p>“The cybersecurity landscape is at a crossroads of unprecedented technological advancements and mounting challenges compounded by geopolitical and systemic supply chain risks,” said Paolo Dal Cin, global lead, Accenture Security. “Helping our clients adopt cybersecurity solutions powered by gen AI will enable them to effectively navigate change, accelerate business protection and become cyber-and business-resilient organizations.”</p>
        <p><strong>New Cybersecurity Services</strong><br>According to <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2024-07-30-gartner-survey-shows-rising-concern-of-ai-enhanced-malicious-attacks-as">Gartner®</a>, concern about AI-enhanced malicious attacks again topped Gartner, Inc.’s emerging risk rankings in the second quarter of 2024. To help clients safely adopt emerging technologies while simultaneously tackling evolving threats, Accenture is introducing new services, which it also employs to protect its business operations. Some of these include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong><a href="https://www.accenture.com/us-en/secureai">Secure AI Solutions</a></strong> establishes resilience throughout an organization’s entire AI program lifecycle, including best practices for developing frameworks; policies and processes to ensure secure AI practices; capabilities to assess and protect access, data, models, infrastructure and building trust-by-design in AI systems. It also incorporates red-teaming and adversarial simulations that help find vulnerabilities in AI systems, including LLMs and a Gen AI Security Diagnostic to detect and secure unauthorized AI deployments.</li>
          <li><strong><a href="https://www.accenture.com/us-en/services/cybersecurity/cyber-protection/deepfakes">Deepfake Protection</a></strong> includes security testing, monitoring and detection of deepfakes powered by key partners’ technologies such as <a href="https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/2024/accenture-invests-in-reality-defender-to-help-fight-deepfake-extortion-fraud-and-disinformation">Reality Defender</a> to stay ahead of evolving AI threats that are impacting customer contact centers, business videoconferences and other critical points of communication.</li>
          <li><strong><a href="https://www.accenture.com/us-en/services/cybersecurity/cyber-resilience/cyber-response-crisis-management">Business Cyber Crisis Recovery</a></strong> a cloud-based solution enables C-suite leaders across industries such as healthcare, telecommunications and oil &#x26; gas to quickly restore essential infrastructure and significantly reduce the downtime impacts associated with recovering from a cyberattack. As a result, essential operations can be restored in hours rather than weeks.</li>
          <li><strong><a href="https://www.accenture.com/us-en/services/emerging-technology/quantum-security">Quantum Security Suite</a></strong> of services for building robust strategies, discovering vulnerable encryption throughout an enterprise and replacing outdated technology by leveraging the latest quantum-safe algorithms recommended by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology and orchestrating their use securely and efficiently.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Core Cybersecurity Services – Newly Powered by Gen AI</strong><br>Many organizations (86%) are either actively or planning to consolidate their tools as a means to streamline their cybersecurity operations[1]. In response, Accenture is powering its core cybersecurity offerings with the <a href="https://www.accenture.com/us-en/services/cybersecurity/cyber-protection/mysecurity">Accenture mySecurity</a> a centralized suite of assets that integrates gen AI into all cyber-resilience services across supply chain, cloud, application, cyber resilience and identity and access management to drive speed, efficiency and help clients protect against AI-driven threats.

        <p><br>For example, Accenture is actively working to shield nations from cyberattacks and is helping the Kuwait Government Central Agency for Information Technology to strengthen their cybersecurity infrastructure through the establishment and management of a National Security Operations Center.
