        <p><br>MELBOURNE; Nov. 30, 2020 – Accenture (NYSE: ACN) has acquired Olikka, a Melbourne-based provider of cloud migration and related services, enhancing Accenture’s Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure capabilities, as well as its broader cloud capabilities across Australia and New Zealand.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>Founded in 2011, Olikka is a cloud-native solutions provider with approximately 50 full-time employees, including a robust team of certified professionals with extensive experience in AWS and other cloud platforms. As an AWS Advanced Consulting Partner, the company specializes in native cloud-based application development, cloud modernization development and security. Olikka also boasts Microsoft Azure capabilities and strong experience with Windows on AWS.<br><br>The addition of Olikka’s team will further enhance the global capabilities of <a href="http://www.accenture.com/cloud">Accenture Cloud First</a>, a multi-service group providing the full stack of cloud services to help clients across every industry become "cloud first" businesses so they can accelerate their digital transformation, innovate faster, and create differentiated, sustainable value. Powered by 70,000 cloud professionals, and a $3 billion investment over the next three years, the group brings together an unmatched depth and breadth of cloud expertise, industry cloud solutions, ecosystem partner capabilities and assets that help clients realize greater value from cloud at speed and scale.<br><br>“Olikka’s extensive experience with AWS and Azure, coupled with their strong cloud-native capabilities in high demand areas such as application modernization and security, means we can go straight to the heart of our clients’ most pressing challenges and fully deliver value,” said Karthik Narain, global lead for Accenture Cloud First. “With the addition of Olikka’s talented team of cloud application developers, we’ll be better positioned than ever to help companies in the Australian and New Zealand market deliver on the promise of technology and human ingenuity.”<br><br>Many companies have not yet completed their digital transformation and urgently need to fast-track their innovation journeys. Cloud is the key enabler to complete their transformation, and COVID-19 has further accelerated this mandate. This accelerated transition will shift companies to about 80% cloud in the next three years, and Accenture Cloud First is well positioned to help them achieve the strongest business outcomes possible.<br><br>“The addition of Olikka will immediately reinforce Accenture’s position as a leading AWS and Microsoft Azure cloud partner in the Australia-New Zealand market,” said Scott Hahn, technology lead for Australia and New Zealand. “We’re confident it will also accelerate our growth through services complimentary to our Cloud First capabilities.”</p>
