The result would be differentiated solutions with flexible delivery options for bundled industry cloud deployment. The companies will co-invest in resources and appoint dedicated executives to bring maximum value to mutual clients. The planned key benefits include:</p>

          <li>Enriching solutions by combining SAP and Accenture’s deep industry expertise, as well as extensive product knowledge</li>
          <li>Shortening time to market by leveraging Accenture delivery expertise for core and industry cloud solutions development for SAP S/4HANA</li>
          <li>New apps for SAP S/4HANA Finance using the SAP Fiori® user experience to bring an enhanced and simplified user experience and increased productivity across finance functions</li>
          <li>Accelerating adoption of SAP S/4HANA and shortening clients’ time to digital value by aligning and scaling joint go-to-market efforts</li>
        </ul>
        <p>”Our enhanced agreement with Accenture signifies another key step to further strengthen our commitment to SAP S/4HANA,” said Bernd Leukert, member of the Executive Board, Products &#x26; Innovation, SAP. “We look forward to working with Accenture to drive digital transformation for businesses with even simpler solutions that accelerate time to value.
