        <p>ThinkTank’s Engage platform is used to guide teams through complex planning and transformation programs with clear alignment and better decision-making. This evolves business transformation from a fragmented, risky process to a strategic priority for ensuring mission-critical projects are delivered on time, on budget, in-scope and are well-adopted. The Engage platform can reduce implementation costs by up to 20%, speed design phases by 40%, and increase rate of adoption by users by 50%.</p>

        <p><br>The Engage platform will be integrated with <a href="https://www.accenture.com/us-en/services/technology/myconcerto">Accenture myConcerto</a>® for a single, proprietary platform that simplifies and accelerates technology-led business transformation. The new functionality will improve collaboration and workflow across teams, with better visibility into requirements, program progress and deadlines, enabling better engagement and prioritization. ThinkTank will also extend myConcerto’s intelligent automation capabilities and provisioning of industry-specific business process templates for agile, continuous delivery. Accenture myConcerto is currently available for multiple platform partners, including Adobe, Microsoft, Oracle, Salesforce, SAP and Workday.<br><br>“Intelligent platforms can generate new value by amplifying the power of data and technology. However, planning and design processes can be complex if all stakeholders aren’t engaged or collaborating on decisions,” said Emma McGuigan, global lead, Accenture Intelligent Platform Services. “ThinkTank Engage will be a natural extension of myConcerto, helping clients to better engage across stakeholder groups and digitize design and agile planning programs. The platform will empower clients to more easily create a personalized business case, roadmap and solution prototype, then integrating and automating processes for faster deployment and time to value.”<br><br>“After working with Accenture for years, we’re thrilled to be joining the company and helping change the way enterprises define, deliver, and maintain the strategic software that runs their business,” said Nick Parnaby, CEO, ThinkTank. “The ThinkTank Engage platform spurs better alignment and decision-making during complex enterprise business and technology transformations. Combining these capabilities with myConcerto and Accenture’s expertise, the result is a platform that seamlessly connects the people who define and operate essential business processes to the software that enables them, building truly agile enterprises.”<br><br>ThinkTank is a cloud-enabled SaaS business based in Denver, Colorado.
