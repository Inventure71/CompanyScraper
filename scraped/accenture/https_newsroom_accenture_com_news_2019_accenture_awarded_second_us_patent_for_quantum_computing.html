        <p><br><br>Patent is for a machine learning module that selects quantum or classical computing for optimal business outcomes</p>
        <p><br>NEW YORK; July 1, 2019 – Accenture (NYSE: ACN) has been granted a US patent for a “quantum computing machine learning module” that trains artificial intelligence (AI) models to determine when and how computational tasks would be best handled by quantum computing versus classical computing methods, and route them to the appropriate option. In doing so, it could help organizations understand where quantum computing can have the most impact within their businesses, and when classical computing may still be the best option for a given task.</p>

        <p>Accenture’s new patent — U.S. Patent No. 10,275,721 — describes a solution to address the tradeoff between the benefits of using quantum computing versus classical computing resources. By determining when and how to utilize the power of quantum computing, such a system can help perform computational tasks in the most efficient and cost-effective way possible. Additionally, the module described has the ability to learn to prioritize certain tasks. As more advanced and efficient quantum and classical systems are introduced over time, the quantum computing machine learning module can adapt accordingly.<br><br>“Quantum computing has enormous potential, offering truly groundbreaking capabilities to rapidly solve businesses’ most difficult computational challenges. And determining when to employ quantum — as opposed to, or in tandem with classical computing — is critical to realizing this potential,” said Marc Carrel-Billiard, senior managing director, Accenture Labs. “Our latest patent in this area reflects our ongoing commitment to explore ways to apply the best technologies at the right times for our clients to achieve better business outcomes.”<br><br>This patent adds to Accenture’s robust global intellectual property portfolio, including a <a href="/news/accenture-awarded-us-patent-for-combining-classical-and-quantum-computing-with-potential-to-address-previously-unsolvable-business-problems.htm">patent that Accenture was awarded</a> for a “multi-state quantum optimization engine” in 2018. It also builds on years of Accenture’s quantum investments, partnerships and R&#x26;D efforts.<br><br>“Clients look to Accenture to help drive innovation in their organizations, and we are committed to embracing this opportunity at every turn,” said Athina Kanioura, Accenture’s chief analytics officer and global head of Applied Intelligence. “Working to advance applications for AI has been a huge focus for our team, and quantum computing presents yet another avenue for how we can use AI to maximize value.”<br><br>The patent for the quantum computing machine learning module was co-invented by several Accenture associates: Carl Dukatz, principal director in Accenture’s quantum computing practice; Daniel Garrison, managing director at Accenture Digital; and Lascelles Forrester, managing director at Accenture Digital.<br><br>To learn more about Accenture and its quantum computing work, please visit <a href="https://www.accenture.com/quantum">www.accenture.com/quantum</a>.<br><br><strong>About Accenture</strong><br>Accenture is a leading global professional services company, providing a broad range of services and solutions in strategy, consulting, digital, technology and operations.
