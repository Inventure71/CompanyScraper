        <p>Recent cyberattacks have exposed how greater interconnectivity, network access and ecosystem vulnerabilities can affect even the most secure businesses. In fact, <a href="https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insights/security/cyber-resilient-ceo?c=acn_glb_cyber-resilientmediarelations_13979475&#x26;n=mrl_0923">Accenture’s Cyber-Resilient CEO research</a> found that around half (51%) of CEOs ranked supply chain as the second highest external risk, underscoring the vulnerabilities of global organizations across their value chains.</p>
        <p>“Supply chain security attacks are happening all too often when security is not embedded at the core of the business and across suppliers,” said Paolo Dal Cin, global lead of Accenture Security. “This is particularly concerning when <a href="https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Global_Cybersecurity_Outlook_2024.pdf">more than half of executives</a> say their organizations have an insufficient understanding of cyber vulnerabilities in their supply chain. To address this issue, Tenchi and Accenture will offer organizations a complete supply chain risk management security solution that will allow them to identify cyber risks faster and assist in addressing cyber threats.”</p>
        <p>Felipe Boucas, CEO of Tenchi, said, “While there is a growing awareness of the need to manage cybersecurity risks across a company’s supply chain, there is a lack of verified, integrated and continuous data and effective remediation. With Accenture’s deep experience in managed security services, we will help organizations build trust between their business, suppliers, and partners, while offering ways to improve upon their cybersecurity and the cyber hygiene of the ecosystem as a whole.”</p>
        <p>Tenchi Security is the latest company to join Accenture Ventures’ <a href="https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/accenture-launches-project-spotlight-a-new-approach-to-venture-capital.htm">Project Spotlight</a>, an engagement and investment program that targets emerging technology companies that can help fill strategic innovation gaps for Global 2000 organizations.
