          <li><strong>Clinical Trial Companion for Life Sciences:</strong> As a clinical trial companion, AI agents can work with patients and clinicians to personalize trial plans, outline tasks and requirements from start to finish and provide guidance and motivation throughout a patient’s clinical trial journey. AI agents can be trained to answer trial-specific questions in real-time, offering clarity, support and a seamless experience, while reducing participant drop-out rates and driving greater success and value in clinical trials.</li>
          <li><strong>Asset Troubleshooting for Industrial:</strong> Using advanced multi-agent systems, engineers and operators can be empowered to swiftly troubleshoot or resolve industrial equipment issues. By integrating real-time data, signal correlation, automated inspections, and actionable recommendations, this system can help to maintain operational excellence by reducing downtime, enhancing decision-making, and transitioning autonomous maintenance from reactive to proactive.</li>
          <li><strong>B2B Marketing:</strong> AI agents will provide strategic insights, automate workflows, and enhance decision-making, helping marketers deliver faster, smarter and more consistent campaigns. Agents centralize cultural, client, competitor and company data to craft relevant marketing strategies, and provide insights on program performance, sales growth opportunities and future planning optimization.</li>
