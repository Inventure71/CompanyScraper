        <p><br>NEW YORK and TORONTO; May 5, 2020 – Accenture (NYSE: ACN) has acquired Callisto Integration (“Callisto”), a Canada-based provider of consulting and technology services. The company provides digital manufacturing services to large companies in the food and beverage, chemicals, utilities and other industries. The acquisition expands Accenture’s capabilities to help clients in North America ensure the timely production of orders, increase their yield and enhance the quality of their products.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>Among Callisto’s key services are the design and implementation of manufacturing execution systems, industrial internet of things (IoT) systems and shop-floor control systems. These systems ensure the materials, workers and equipment for each production order are ready when needed. They also provide real-time data on the production process. As a result, companies can better detect and address quality issues and more accurately predict machine failure.<br><br>The 160 Callisto employees join Accenture’s <a href="https://www.accenture.com/us-en/services/industryx0-index">Industry X.0</a> practice. This part of Accenture uses digital technologies — such as the IoT, data analytics and artificial intelligence — to improve how companies design, engineer and manufacture products and services and operate industrial facilities.</p>
