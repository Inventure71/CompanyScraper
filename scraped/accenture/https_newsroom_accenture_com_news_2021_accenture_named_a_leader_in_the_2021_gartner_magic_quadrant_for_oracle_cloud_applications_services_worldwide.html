        <p><br>For the report, 18 service providers were evaluated based on completeness of vision and ability to execute worldwide. The report’s authors note, “It is critical to understand that for this Magic Quadrant, Cloud practice growth is a strong indicator of vision, not only execution, as this market represents the need to pivot from on-premises to cloud. This pivoting can ‘cannibalize’ existing revenue streams.” They go on to explain that “Pivoting successfully clearly reflects a vendor’s ability to ‘do’ cloud in a way that resonates with clients, which is a strong indicator of vision. Pivoting also includes a substantial focus on reskilling existing talent with cloud capabilities as well as moving a portion of them from the on-premises practice to cloud.”<br><br>Accenture has unmatched global expertise across a full range of Oracle Solutions with thousands of Oracle-skilled consultants around the world who help accelerate digital transformation by implementing Oracle-based business solutions and new business processes that develop and evolve as their digital business grows.
