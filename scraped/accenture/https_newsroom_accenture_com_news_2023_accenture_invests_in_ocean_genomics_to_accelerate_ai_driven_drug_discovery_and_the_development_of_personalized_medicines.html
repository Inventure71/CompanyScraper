        <p>Based in Pittsburgh, Ocean Genomics creates software that provides modeling and an understanding of changes and variants in mRNA to enable a more accurate prediction of a patient’s biological response to a drug. The expression of mRNA is a central biological process that occurs in every cell and helps govern nearly all aspects of normal functioning and is often disrupted in disease. In collaboration with Ocean Genomics, biopharma companies use the technology in <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1978274/#:~:text=The%20term%20%E2%80%99in%20silico%E2%80%99%20is,in%20vivo%20and%20in%20vitro.">in-silico drug discovery</a> to develop treatments based on an individual’s personal biology. The <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/personalized-medicine-market-size-worth-796-8-billion-by-2028---grand-view-research-inc-301590829.html">global personalized medicine market</a> size is expected to reach more than $796 billion by 2028.</p>
