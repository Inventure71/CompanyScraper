        <p>Accenture’s position in the Leaders quadrant comes as Gartner cited that by 2025, more than 80% of public cloud managed and professional services deals will require both hybrid cloud and multi-cloud capabilities from the provider, up from less than 50% in 2020.<br><br>“With unparalleled technology and industry experience, a broad partner ecosystem and right-fit solutions, Accenture helps our clients outmaneuver uncertainty, starting with rapid migration and extending across the full cloud estate, including infrastructure, applications, data, and security,” said Kishore Durg, senior managing director, Intelligent Cloud &#x26; Infrastructure lead and ventures &#x26; acquisitions lead for Accenture Technology Services. “We believe this Gartner recognition confirms Accenture’s value to help enterprise clients grow their digital services with speed and scale, while accelerating their business innovation and growth.”<br><br>For the report, Gartner analyzed the capabilities of 20 companies that deliver managed cloud and professional services relating to infrastructure and platform operations worldwide. Gartner assessed each organization’s ability to execute and completeness of vision to classify them into four groups: Leaders, Challengers, Visionaries, and Niche Players.<br><br><em>*Source: Gartner, Magic Quadrant for Public Cloud Infrastructure Professional and Managed Services, Worldwide, Craig Lowery, To Chee Eng, Scot MacLellan, Ross Winser, Brandon Medford, 4 May 2020.</em><br><br><em>Gartner does not endorse any vendor, product or service depicted in its research publications, and does not advise technology users to select only those vendors with the highest ratings or other designation.
