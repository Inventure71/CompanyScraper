        <p>The awards competition, which recognizes the best insurance technology innovations, attracted nearly 360 entries from 240 institutions in 45 countries — even amidst the uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, which drove the awards ceremony to be held virtually this year rather than in person.<br><br>The winners were selected by a panel of judges comprising senior executives from insurers worldwide. Each entry was assessed using three criteria: originality; strategic capacity to generate long-term competitive edge and return on investment; and adaptability for use in other markets and countries.<br><br>The winners of the Efma-Accenture Innovation in Insurance Awards 2020 are:</p>

          <li><strong>Munich Re Group (Germany)</strong> — which won the Core Insurance Transformation award for “MIRApply Physician,” a digitalization of the life insurance application process, with a focus on reducing follow-up inquiries and shortening application times.</li>
