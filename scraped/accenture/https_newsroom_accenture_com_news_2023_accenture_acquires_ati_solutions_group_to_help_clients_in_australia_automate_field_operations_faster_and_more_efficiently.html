        <p>ATI offers clients a broad skill set and has experience across a wide range of capital projects. It helps clients automate and remotely run mines and rail networks, set up smart maintenance workflows, analyze data from the field, and optimize their operations. The company excels at implementing operational technology (OT) – which companies use to run assets like mining equipment – and connecting OT to enterprise IT systems. Better IT and OT integration allows companies to identify issues and automate processes in their field operations faster and more efficiently.<br><br>Steven Walsh, <a href="https://www.accenture.com/us-en/about/industry-x-index">Industry X</a> lead for Accenture in Australia and NZ, said: “Digital technology and automation in operations are a pivotal part of how leading asset-intensive companies drive value in their front-line operations. ATI’s long-standing expertise strengthens our capability to support our clients in these critical areas.”</p>
