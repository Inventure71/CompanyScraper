        <p>“The combination of MNEMO Mexico’s managed cybersecurity services, extensive industry expertise and strong client base makes them an ideal partner to complement our existing capabilities. The addition of MNEMO Mexico’s team will help us grow our business in Mexico, expand our presence in Latin America and support our North America business,” said Paolo Dal Cin, who leads Accenture Security globally. “Together, we will help organizations build more cyber-resilient businesses and secure their digital cores, technologies and supply chains.”<br><br>MNEMO Mexico’s cybersecurity professionals will join Accenture Security’s workforce of more than 19,500 professionals globally, extending Accenture’s local resources and capabilities in Mexico / Latin America while addressing the growing regional demand for managed security services.<br><br>“The constantly shifting digital world is both a source of opportunity and risk, making it essential to have a well-trained and proficient cybersecurity team,” said Julian Garrido, General Director of MNEMO Mexico. “For more than 20 years our clients have counted on us to safeguard them against destructive cyberattacks. We are excited to join Accenture Security so we can collaborate across industries to help clients in Mexico and around the world build a secure future.”<br><br>Mexico consistently ranks among the top countries <a href="https://latamciso.com/Report2023ENG.pdf">in Latin America</a> hardest hit by cyberattacks. Additionally, a report in collaboration with the <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2023/02/cybersecurity-how-to-improve-resilience-and-support-a-workforce-in-transition/">World Economic Forum’s Global Cybersecurity Outlook 2023</a> and Accenture revealed that 59% of business leaders and 64% of cyber leaders ranked talent recruitment and retention as a key challenge for managing cyber resilience. And less than half of respondents reported having the people and skills needed today to respond to cyberattacks.<br><br>“We are proud to welcome the MNEMO Mexico team to Accenture. Their robust cybersecurity capabilities and commitment to a collaborative work culture are essential as we look to meet the increasing demand for managed security services in the market," said Andre Fleury, who leads Accenture Security in Latin America. “We are confident that we will bring tremendous talent and capability to our clients.”<br><br>Accenture recently <a href="https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insights/technology/analyst-recognitions">ranked No. 1 in managed security services (MSS) market share by revenue</a> in the Gartner® Market Share: Managed Security Services, Worldwide, 2022 report, 18 April 2023 *.
