Together with Microsoft, we are helping Currys raise the bar in the retail industry, reach new frontiers of performance and efficiency, and create new value and growth.”</p>
        <p>Ralph Haupter, President, EMEA at Microsoft said “AI is rapidly unlocking new opportunities for every organisation and every industry around the world. By deploying the latest cloud and AI technologies, Currys can enhance the shopping experience for millions of customers, both in-store and online, whilst ensuring its 25,000 employees have the insights at their fingertips to unlock value across the entire business.”</p>
