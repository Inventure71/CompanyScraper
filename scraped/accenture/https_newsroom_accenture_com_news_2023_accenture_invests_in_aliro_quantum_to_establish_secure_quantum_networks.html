        <p>Quantum computing uses fundamental physics and math principles to deliver insights and simulations accurately and incredibly fast. This has potential to help companies in numerous industries solve complex business problems and engage transformative capabilities, such as discovering new treatments in life sciences, improving wealth management scenarios in financial services, and rerouting supply chains in real time. But as businesses ramp up quantum-related efforts, it is key to also consider quantum-specific security protocols and threat monitoring.<br><br>Solutions from Aliro enable businesses to automate the orchestration and control of quantum networks for use cases including with quantum secure communications, scaling quantum computing, distributed quantum sensing, and the quantum internet. Aliro uses entanglement-based quantum cryptography to allow senders and receivers to produce shared knowledge and outcomes, while also minimizing risk of a third party maliciously gaining access.</p>
