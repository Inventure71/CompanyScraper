        <p><em>*IDC MarketScape vendor analysis model is designed to provide an overview of the competitive fitness of ICT suppliers in a given market. The research methodology utilizes a rigorous scoring methodology based on both qualitative and quantitative criteria that results in a single graphical illustration of each vendor’s position within a given market. The Capabilities score measures vendor product, go-to-market and business execution in the short-term. The Strategy score measures alignment of vendor strategies with customer requirements in a 3-5-year timeframe. Vendor market share is represented by the size of the icons.</em></p>
        <p>According to the report, “It is hard to pick out a singular strength beyond the fact that Accenture is strong in virtually everything IDC evaluated. Several buyers noted Accenture had done a fantastic job, often very quickly. One buyer, in the utilities sector, said that Accenture gave it the best education about the sector it had ever had. Referrals are another strong factor. While none of the cloud service providers like to state so publicly so as to maintain harmony with all their implementation partners, buyers shared examples where they were informed by a cloud service provider that Accenture was preferred among its partners.”<br><br>“Accenture — with its strong industry knowledge, industry cloud offers, and breadth of technology services that span from consulting all the way to managed services — can fulfill cloud technology implementation needs at a global scale,” said Gard Little, vice president of Global Services, Markets and Trends at IDC.<br><br>Karthik Narain, global lead of Accenture Cloud First, said, “Cloud is no longer just a migration destination. It is foundational to enterprise reinvention and business resilience. It’s an operating model for innovation and a place where many of the world’s technology breakthroughs are happening — from AI, to edge computing, to the metaverse. This recognition from the IDC MarketScape further validates our approach to cloud as a driver of business change, not just a technology change. We are helping our clients shape, move and operate their business on cloud and get to value faster.”<br><br>This research assessed 20 service providers in global cloud professional services. The scope of this analysis included IT consulting, systems integration, network consulting &#x26; integration, and custom application development — professional services around the plan, design and build phase — for both hybrid and multi-cloud delivery models.<br><br><strong>About IDC MarketScape</strong><br>IDC MarketScape vendor assessment model is designed to provide an overview of the competitive fitness of ICT (information and communications technology) suppliers in a given market.
