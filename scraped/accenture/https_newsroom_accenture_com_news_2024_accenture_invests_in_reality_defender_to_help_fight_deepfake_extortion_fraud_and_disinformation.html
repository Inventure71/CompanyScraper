        <p>Founded in 2021 and based in New York, Reality Defender provides detection against advanced threats posed by deepfakes and AI-generated content. The company's comprehensive solutions for enterprises, government and institutional clients help protect against everything from advanced voice fraud in call centers to media verification in newsrooms. Reality Defender's real-time voice detection platform catches audio-based deepfakes as they happen, while audiovisual detection finds even the most advanced AI-generated faces in images and videos made using the latest generative AI models.</p>
        <p>Reality Defender was named the Most Innovative Company at this year's <a href="https://twitter.com/RSAConference/status/1787585508841083299">RSA Innovation Sandbox competition</a>. The company is also a graduate of the <a href="https://www.fintechinnovationlab.com/news/new-york/fintech-innovation-lab-new-york-announces-2024-class/">FinTech Innovation Lab New York</a>, a 12-week program co-founded and co-run by Accenture.</p>

        <p>“As deepfakes become more convincing and harder to identify, organizations urgently need scalable and effective detection solutions,” said Paolo Dal Cin, global lead, Accenture Security. “Reality Defender offers a unique approach to proactively detect AI-related threats across image, audio, text and video. Our investment in Reality Defender demonstrates our strong commitment to helping clients confidently navigate the gen AI driven threat landscape, mitigate financial fraud and maintain the integrity of their digital communications.”</p>
        <p>Cybercriminals are increasingly exploiting the power of generative AI and advanced large language models to unleash novel cyberattacks. <a href="https://www.accenture.com/us-en/blogs/security/beyond-illusion-unmasking-real-threats-deepfakes">Accenture's Cyber Intelligence researchers</a> have documented a staggering 223% spike in deepfake-related tool trading on dark web forums in the first quarter of 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. This escalating issue requires immediate attention and education to reduce its potential damaging impacts.</p>
        <p>“Accenture’s global reach and cybersecurity expertise will allow Reality Defender to scale our technology during a time of heightened deepfake volatility,” said Ben Colman, Co-Founder and CEO of Reality Defender. “With Accenture’s support and alignment with our mission of combatting AI-generated fraud, we can work toward defeating the most advanced cyber threats of our time. Through our collaborative efforts, we will pave the way for a more secure and trustworthy digital landscape, ensuring a safer future for all.”</p>
        <p>Accenture intends to integrate Reality Defender’s capabilities into its existing <a href="https://www.accenture.com/us-en/services/cybersecurity/cyber-protection/deepfakes">deepfake detection and protection offering,</a> including extending it to their call center AI automation solution.</p>
        <p>“Financial services firms remain prime targets for bad actors, and deepfakes present a new, advanced threat to guard against,” said Steve Murphy, Accenture’s Financial Services industry solutions lead. “Reality Defender is already helping large financial institutions to detect deepfakes and ensure that their customers’ assets remain secure.”</p>
        <p>Reality Defender is the latest company to join Accenture Ventures’ <a href="https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/2020/accenture-launches-project-spotlight-a-new-approach-to-venture-capital">Project Spotlight</a>, an engagement and investment program focused on working with companies that create or apply disruptive enterprise technologies.
