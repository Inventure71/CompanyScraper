        <p>The two companies will explore new applications to scale generative AI; for example, assets from Accenture’s <a href="https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insights/accenture-invest-3-billion-ai-accelerate-clients-reinvention">AI Navigator</a> or its proprietary “<a href="https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/2023/accenture-launches-specialized-services-to-help-companies-customize-and-manage-foundation-models">switchboard</a>,” which allows a user to select a combination of models to address the unique business context.</p>
        <p>“This collaboration builds on our relationship of more than three decades with Unilever, which continues to raise the bar as a digital powerhouse and industry leader,” said Julie Sweet, chair and CEO, Accenture. “The combination of Horizon3 Labs’ disruptive innovation with Accenture’s deep expertise and strong ecosystem partnerships will help Unilever scale AI and generative AI more rapidly and responsibly across its business and discover new pathways to value.”</p>
