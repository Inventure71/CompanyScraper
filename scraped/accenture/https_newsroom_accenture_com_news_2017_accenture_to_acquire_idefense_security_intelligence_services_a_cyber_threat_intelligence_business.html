        <p><br><br>Acquisition will boost Accenture Security’s ability to provide tailored threat intelligence services and address enterprise security needs</p>
        <p><br>ARLINGTON, VA; Feb. 9, 2017 – Accenture (NYSE: ACN) has entered into an agreement to acquire the iDefense Security Intelligence Services business from VeriSign, Inc. iDefense, one of the world’s first and most prolific cyber threat intelligence businesses, has proven capabilities in cyber intelligence related to vulnerabilities, malicious code and global threats to organizations. iDefense’s next generation intelligence platform specializes in delivering faster access to relevant, timely and actionable security intelligence, enabling organizations to make smarter security decisions and defend against new and evolving threats. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed. Completion of the acquisition is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.</p>

        <p>Complementing recent security investments, the acquisition of iDefense augments Accenture Security’s existing Cyber Defense Services with targeted threat intelligence that Accenture will embed into services it manages for clients’ security operations. iDefense has amassed vast amounts of proprietary threat intelligence data over the past 18 years – data that powers its application program interfaces (APIs) and its distinctive analysis platform, IntelGraph. In addition to directly providing threat intelligence to Fortune 500 customers, Accenture will fuel its cybersecurity platform with these capabilities to enhance its ability to inform clients where threats are forming and coming from, and what actions to take – much earlier than other providers who leverage public data feeds.<br><br>iDefense’s capabilities will also become an integral component of Accenture’s adversary simulation, threat hunting and incident response services. Accenture’s Global Delivery Network of security professionals will further enhance iDefense’s offerings through new telemetry sources and innovative threat intelligence services designed to help organizations achieve maximum value from security technologies.<br><br>“There simply isn’t enough time, budget or human resources to defend against every imaginable attack scenario or adversary without intelligent systems and automation. That’s why having the best available threat intelligence is critical to helping us protect our clients’ entire value chains, allowing them to focus on innovation and growth,” said Kelly Bissell, managing director of Accenture Security. “We are confident that the collective capabilities of Accenture Security and iDefense can help organizations better understand where threats are coming from and adjust protections before damage is done.”<br><br>Recent <a href="https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insight-building-confidence-facing-cybersecurity-conundrum">research</a> by Accenture reveals that companies often lack strategic threat intelligence and proper tools to identify as well as monitor threats. Fewer than two in five organizations report they are competent at monitoring and evaluating business relevant threats.<br><br>“iDefense has always been recognized for our differentiated and innovative approach to security intelligence and vulnerability management. Our contextual cyber intelligence is delivered to clients in a highly consumable way, so they can confidently use it to enhance a security control, drive a course of action or mitigate risk effectively in their business,” said Josh Ray, Vice President, iDefense Security Intelligence Services. “We are very excited by this opportunity to bring our unparalleled threat intelligence services to Accenture Security’s extensive portfolio of end-to-end security and technology services.<br><br>Founded in 1998 and headquartered in Northern Virginia, iDefense serves top-tier organizations across a range of industries – including banking, communications, media, technology and products.<br><br>The acquisition of iDefense builds on Accenture Security’s commitment to investing in and innovating advanced threat intelligence and cybersecurity solutions.

These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. These include, without limitation, risks that: Accenture and VeriSign will not be able to close the transaction in the time period anticipated, or at all, which is dependent on the parties’ ability to satisfy certain closing conditions; the transaction might not achieve the anticipated benefits for Accenture; Accenture’s results of operations could be adversely affected by volatile, negative or uncertain economic conditions and the effects of these conditions on the company’s clients’ businesses and levels of business activity; Accenture’s business depends on generating and maintaining ongoing, profitable client demand for the company’s services and solutions including through the adaptation and expansion of its services and solutions in response to ongoing changes in technology and offerings, and a significant reduction in such demand or an inability to respond to the changing technological environment could materially affect the company’s results of operations; if Accenture is unable to keep its supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand around the world and attract and retain professionals with strong leadership skills, the company’s business, the utilization rate of the company’s professionals and the company’s results of operations may be materially adversely affected; the markets in which Accenture competes are highly competitive, and Accenture might not be able to compete effectively; Accenture could have liability or Accenture’s reputation could be damaged if the company fails to protect client and/or company data from security breaches or cyberattacks; Accenture’s profitability could materially suffer if the company is unable to obtain favourable pricing for its services and solutions, if the company is unable to remain competitive, if its cost-management strategies are unsuccessful or if it experiences delivery inefficiencies; changes in Accenture’s level of taxes, as well as audits, investigations and tax proceedings, or changes in tax laws or in their interpretation or enforcement, could have a material adverse effect on the company’s effective tax rate, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition; Accenture’s results of operations could be materially adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; Accenture’s business could be materially adversely affected if the company incurs legal liability; Accenture’s work with government clients exposes the company to additional risks inherent in the government contracting environment; Accenture might not be successful at identifying, acquiring, investing in or integrating businesses, entering into joint ventures or divesting businesses; Accenture’s Global Delivery Network is increasingly concentrated in India and the Philippines, which may expose it to operational risks; as a result of Accenture’s geographically diverse operations and its growth strategy to continue geographic expansion, the company is more susceptible to certain risks; adverse changes to Accenture’s relationships with key alliance partners or in the business of its key alliance partners could adversely affect the company’s results of operations; Accenture’s services or solutions could infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others or the company might lose its ability to utilize the intellectual property of others; if Accenture is unable to protect its intellectual property rights from unauthorized use or infringement by third parties, its business could be adversely affected; Accenture’s ability to attract and retain business and employees may depend on its reputation in the marketplace; if Accenture is unable to manage the organizational challenges associated with its size, the company might be unable to achieve its business objectives; any changes to the estimates and assumptions that Accenture makes in connection with the preparation of its consolidated financial statements could adversely affect its financial results; many of Accenture’s contracts include payments that link some of its fees to the attainment of performance or business targets and/or require the company to meet specific service levels, which could increase the variability of the company’s revenues and impact its margins; Accenture’s results of operations and share price could be adversely affected if it is unable to maintain effective internal controls; Accenture may be subject to criticism and negative publicity related to its incorporation in Ireland; as well as the risks, uncertainties and other factors discussed under the “Risk Factors” heading in Accenture plc’s most recent annual report on Form 10-K and other documents filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission.
