        <p><br>NEW YORK and SAN FRANCISCO; Sept. 1, 2020 – Accenture (NYSE: ACN) has made a strategic investment, through <a href="https://www.accenture.com/us-en/about/ventures-index">Accenture Ventures</a>, in <a href="https://incountry.com/">InCountry</a>, a data residency-as-a-service platform provider.</p>

        <p>As enterprises continue to move large workloads to the cloud, increasingly stringent data protection regulations make handling data appropriately — for each jurisdiction in which they store, process and share information — a critical challenge. InCountry’s data residency-as-a-service platform allows enterprises and software-as-a-service companies to ensure their company and customer data is used in compliance with the data residency regulations of 90+ countries.</p>
