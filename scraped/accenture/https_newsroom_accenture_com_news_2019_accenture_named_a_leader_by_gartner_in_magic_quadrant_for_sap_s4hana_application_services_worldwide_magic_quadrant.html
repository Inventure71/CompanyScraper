        <p>According to Gartner, “This Magic Quadrant addresses the full life cycle of SAP S/4HANA application services, spanning project-based assessment and implementation and multiyear application management services (AMS). Analysts evaluate service providers for their ability to deliver discrete or comprehensive sets of assessment, implementation and management services for clients worldwide, across SAP S/4HANA version 1610 or later and any S/4HANA Cloud version.”<br><br>Christophe Mouille, senior managing director and global lead for the <a href="https://www.accenture.com/us-en/services/sap-index">Accenture SAP Business Group</a>, said, “We believe that this recognition from Gartner reflects our ongoing focus on helping clients create value from new SAP solutions and technologies, as well as our ability to drive end-to-end transformation with industry expertise, intelligence and innovation through <a href="https://www.accenture.com/us-en/service-myconcerto-sap">Accenture myConcerto</a>. With initiatives that focus on co-development and co-innovation around both <a href="https://www.accenture.com/us-en/service-digital-transformation-co-innovate-s4hana-sap">SAP S/4HANA</a> and more recently on experience management and <a href="/news/accenture-and-sap-to-elevate-digital-customer-experiences-through-co-development-and-co-innovation-of-new-industry-solutions-on-sap-c4hana-suite.htm">SAP C/4HANA</a>, our deep and longstanding relationship with SAP and our ability to execute allows our clients to evolve to intelligent enterprises and get the most powerful business outcomes.”<br><br>The Magic Quadrant report, the first of its kind, also states that, “Leaders are performing well today, gaining traction and mind share in the market; they have a clear vision of market direction and are actively building competencies to sustain their leadership position in the market. Leaders have built a considerable S/4HANA track record and capabilities across multiple industries, geographies, deployment approaches or modules.”<br><br>Earlier this year, Accenture also <a href="/news/accenture-wins-two-2019-sap-pinnacle-awards-for-achievements-with-sap-s4hana-and-sap-ariba.htm">won</a> the SAP® Pinnacle Awards for SAP S/4HANA Partner of the Year — Large Enterprise.<br><br>The report evaluates each vendor on its ability to execute and completeness of vision. Additionally, “This Magic Quadrant evaluates 18 service providers’ capabilities to deliver SAP S/4HANA application assessment, implementation and management services on a worldwide basis. This research will help identify, evaluate and select potential SAP S/4HANA application services providers.”<br><br>To view a complimentary copy of Gartner’s 2019 "Magic Quadrant for SAP S/4HANA Application Services, Worldwide” click <a href="https://www.gartner.com/doc/reprints?id=1-6PUFD1B&#x26;ct=190521&#x26;st=sb">here.</a><br><br>1 <em>Gartner, Magic Quadrant for SAP S/4HANA Application Services, Worldwide, 20 May 2019, Fabio Di Capua, Susan Tan, Allan Wilkins</em><br><br><em>Gartner does not endorse any vendor, product or service depicted in its research publications, and does not advise technology users to select only those vendors with the highest ratings or other designation.
