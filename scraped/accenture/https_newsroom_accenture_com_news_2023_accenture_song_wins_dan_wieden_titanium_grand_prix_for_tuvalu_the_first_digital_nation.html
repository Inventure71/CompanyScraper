        <p><br>CANNES, France; Jun. 28, 2023 – At the 2023 Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity, Accenture Song, part of Accenture (NYSE: ACN), won the most prestigious award of the show—The Dan Wieden Titanium Grand Prix, which celebrates game-changing creativity that breaks new industry ground—for Tuvalu, “<a href="https://www.tuvalu.tv/">The First Digital Nation</a>.”</p>

        <p>Due to climate change, the Pacific Island of Tuvalu risks becoming the first country to be submerged from rising sea levels due to climate change. The work, created by The Monkeys—part of Accenture Song—is recognized for re-establishing the tenets of what defines a country, especially when it has no land.<br><br>The creation of the first nation with digital sovereignty preserves not only the country of Tuvalu by protecting its borders and creating digital ones that are officially recognized, but also protects its identity, cultural practices and stories while driving urgent attention and action around climate change.<br><br>This is the second consecutive year that Accenture Song, the world’s largest tech-powered creative group, has clinched a Cannes Lions top honor since its <a href="/news/accenture-announces-accenture-interactives-evolution.htm">brand evolution</a>. Last year, Accenture Song took home the <a href="/news/accenture-song-wins-cannes-lions-direct-grand-prix-for-coinbase.htm">Direct Lions Grand Prix</a> for its Super Bowl spot <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/everyone-wins-at-super-bowl-lvi-wagmi?gi=c202d224fa01">“Less Talk, More Bitcoin”</a> for Coinbase.<br><br>“This work isn’t just a tech idea. It’s far more than storytelling. It’s about changing perception, changing precedence, and reshaping international law,” said David Droga, chief executive officer of Accenture Song. “By creating digital borders, the team is helping the people of Tuvalu protect their rights, enable climate adaptation and mitigation. I am proud of the team for creating a solution that will contribute to a lasting impact on our world.”</p>

        <p>Launched at the annual United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP27), Simon Kofe, minister for justice, communication and foreign affairs for Tuvalu, spoke in a three-minute address, which gradually revealed he was speaking from the first part of the digital nation, the Te Afualika islet. Days after the announcement, a fund for historic loss and damage was established. To-date, 10 nations have agreed to legally recognize the permanency of Tuvalu’s sovereignty regardless of what happens to its physical land—redefining what it means to be a country.</p>

        <p>Tara Ford, chief creative officer of The Monkeys, part of Accenture Song, said: “Tuvalu has been fighting climate change for over 30 years. Without land, you don’t have a nation. You don’t have a place on the world’s stage. Our mission was to help them protect their sovereignty even when the land has gone. We are honored to receive this very special award.”<br><br>Accenture Song also took home a Silver Lion in Sustainable Development Goals Lion and a Bronze Film Lion for Tuvalu “The First Digital Nation."
