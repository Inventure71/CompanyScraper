        <p><em>Accenture Carnival will be able to offer each guest their own personal digital concierge that knows</em><br><em>what they like and can customize their experiences to cater to their individual preferences.</em></p>
        <p>“Carnival is transforming how guests enjoy their cruise vacations by anticipating a guest’s needs, wants and desires throughout their journey and acting on them,” said Michael Jungen, Carnival SVP, Global Experience &#x26; Innovation Design and Technology. “Leveraging Accenture’s experience and expertise in developing innovative technologies will enable us to empower our crew members to provide Carnival guests with a more personalized and enjoyable experience.”<br><br>Beau Williamson, a managing director in Accenture’s Travel Services practice, said, “With its advanced technology platform, Carnival will be able to offer each guest their own personal digital concierge that knows what they like and can customize their experiences to cater to their individual preferences. Crew members will be empowered to personalize their engagement with each guest based on individual preferences, thus delivering the level of customer service typically reserved for only high-end guests.”<br><br>To develop the platform, Accenture will team with other world-class technology and creative organizations; Fjord, Accenture Interactive’s design and innovation unit, is providing primary design support to the crew-interface component – the “Crew Compass.” By incorporating the crew interface with the guest-experience design, Carnival will be able to ensure that the right crew is available at the right place and right time to provide the most-relevant guest service.<br><br>The new guest-experience platform will debut in late 2017 on the Regal Princess ship of the company’s Princess Cruises brand. The platform will then be rolled out to the Royal Princess and Caribbean Princess ships in 2018 and to the rest of the Princess Cruises fleet over multiple years.<br><br><strong>About Accenture</strong><br>Accenture is a leading global professional services company, providing a broad range of services and solutions in strategy, consulting, digital, technology and operations.
