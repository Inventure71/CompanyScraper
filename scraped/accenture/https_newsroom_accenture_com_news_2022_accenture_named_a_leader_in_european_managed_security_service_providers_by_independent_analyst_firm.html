        <p><br>NEW YORK; Sept. 13, 2022 – Accenture (NYSE: ACN) has been named a Leader in the latest Forrester Research report on European managed security service (MSS) providers, which notes that Accenture sets itself apart from the rest of the market by the way in which it develops assets that are embedded in its services for the benefit of clients.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>The report — "<a href="https://reprints2.forrester.com/#/assets/2/77/RES176380/report">The Forrester Wave™: European Managed Security Service Providers, Q3 2022</a>" — includes a comprehensive 39-criteria assessment of the top 10 cybersecurity consulting providers across three high-level categories: “Current Offering”; “Strategy”; and “Market Presence.” Client references and buyer feedback were also factored into each criterion evaluated in the report.</p>

        <p><br>Accenture received the highest score in the Current Offering category among competitors evaluated, with the highest possible score in twelve criteria, including: data sovereignty and European service delivery; managed application security; business and technical value; product vision; execution roadmap; innovation roadmap; and partner ecosystem.<br><br>The report says that:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Accenture stands out for its vision roadmap, with several planned items focusing on emerging CISO [chief information service officer] needs for managed services providers.</li>
          <li>Accenture also continues to set the standard for strong partnerships to drive unique technology and services IP.</li>
          <li>When noting how Accenture sets itself apart by developing assets that are embedded in services for clients, the report said that one particularly strong example of this was its Intelligent Application Security Platform (IASP), which delivers significant value for developers within its application security services.</li>
          <li>Reference customers praise the flexible personnel, highly competent technical staff, and strong partnership approach.</li>
          <li>Accenture is a good match for customers who want end-to-end security capabilities that deliver a wide array of managed services.</li>
        </ul>
