        <p><em>SOURCE: IDC MarketScape: Worldwide Managed Security Services 2020 Vendor Assessment, by Martha Vazquez, September 2020, IDC # US46235320</em><br><br><em>IDC MarketScape vendor analysis model is designed to provide an overview of the competitive fitness of ICT suppliers in a given market. The research methodology utilizes a rigorous scoring methodology based on both qualitative and quantitative criteria that results in a single graphical illustration of each vendor’s position within a given market. The Capabilities score measures vendor product, go-to-market and business execution in the short-term. The Strategy score measures alignment of vendor strategies with customer requirements in a 3-5-year timeframe. Vendor market share is represented by the size of the circles.</em></p>
        <p><br>The report notes that “midsize to large organizations with global operations in verticals that need tailored or industry-focused security solutions” should consider partnering with Accenture. Earlier this year, Accenture <a href="/news/accenture-completes-acquisition-of-broadcoms-symantec-cyber-security-services-business.htm">acquired Symantec’s Cyber Security Services business</a>, making it one of the leading global providers of MSS and further enhancing its ability to provide tailored, industry-specific security solutions.</p>
        <p>NEWS: @IDC MarketScape names @AccentureSecure a Leader in Managed Security Services</p>
        <p><br><br>“We’re thrilled to be recognized by the IDC MarketScape for the strength in our global managed security services strategy,” said Harpreet Sidhu, who leads Accenture’s Managed Security Services globally. “We have made significant investments in our people and proprietary technology to expand our MSS portfolio over the past year to offer clients a customized approach and solutions that fit their specific needs. Furthermore, we have additional plans to transform the MSS market that will help organizations secure their broader ecosystems. The IDC MarketScape report analysis shows that our tailored approach and dedication to expanding our business and investing in our team of experts is valued and a key differentiator for our clients.”<br><br>Martha Vazquez, a senior research analyst for infrastructure services at IDC, said, “Organizations have difficulty managing and monitoring the constant flow of cyber threats due to a lack of security expertise and disorganization of the tools they’ve already acquired. Managed security service providers like Accenture are finding new and unique ways to service organizations in a way that arms them with the necessary knowledge, detection and response services, as well as the scalability needed to protect their entire business from the always-evolving cyber threat landscape.”<br><br>In addition to being named a Leader in the IDC MarketScape, Accenture was recently positioned as a Leader in <a href="/news/accenture-named-a-leader-in-european-managed-security-services-by-independent-research-firm.htm">The Forrester Wave™: European Managed Security Services Providers, Q3 2020</a> and as one of the Leaders in the <a href="https://newsroom.accenture.in/indian/news/accenture-recognised-as-leader-in-idc-marketscape-report-for-asia-pacific-managed-security-services-vendor-assessment.htm">IDC MarketScape: Asia/Pacific Managed Security Services 2020 Vendor Assessment.</a><br><br>More information about Accenture’s Managed Security Services business and its position in the IDC MarketScape report can be found <a href="https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insights/security/accenture-leader-managed-security">here</a>.<br><br><strong>About IDC MarketScape</strong><br>IDC MarketScape vendor assessment model is designed to provide an overview of the competitive fitness of ICT (information and communications technology) suppliers in a given market.
